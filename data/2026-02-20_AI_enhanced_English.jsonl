At the semidiscrete level, entropy stability is established through the SBP structure and the discrete metric identities associated with curvilinear coordinate mappings. By incorporating entropy-stable numerical fluxes at element interfaces, a global discrete entropy inequality is obtained. To further control nonphysical oscillations near strong discontinuities, the entropy-stable DG formulation is combined with a modified oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) method, which was originally proposed in [59]. We observe that the zero-order damping coefficient in the original OEDG method naturally serves as an effective shock indicator, which enables localization of the oscillation control mechanism and significantly reduces computational cost. Moreover, while the original OEDG formulation relies on local orthogonal modal bases and is primarily restricted to simplicial meshes, we reformulate the OE procedure using projection operators, allowing for a systematic extension to general curvilinear meshes.

However, when dealing with optimal control problems of stochastic Volterra integral equations (SVIEs) with completely monotone kernels, deep mathematical difficulties arise and it is still not understood. These very classical problems have applications in most fields and have now become even more popular due to their applications in mathematical finance under rough volatility. In this article, we consider a class of optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. Via a recent Markovian lift \\cite{FGW2024}, the problem can be reformulated as an optimal control problem of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on suitable Hilbert spaces, which due to the roughness of the kernel, presents a generator of an analytic semigroup and unbounded control and diffusion operators.\n  This analysis leads us to study a general class of optimal control problems of abstract SDEs on Hilbert spaces with unbounded control and diffusion operators. This class includes optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels, but it is also motivated by other models. We analyze the regularity of the associated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck transition semigroup. We prove that the semigroup exhibits a new smoothing property in control directions through a general observation operator $\u0393$, which we call $\u0393$-smoothing. This allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, establish a verification theorem, and construct optimal feedback controls. We apply these results to optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels.
