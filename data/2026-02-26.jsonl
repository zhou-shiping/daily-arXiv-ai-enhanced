To enable reliable simulations, one must quantify how uncertain physical parameters influence model predictions. We propose surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis that combines computational efficiency with a rigorous assessment of parameter influence. In this work, we analyze the recently proposed hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model, which describes fluid flows in coupled free-flow and porous-medium systems with arbitrary flow directions at the fluid--porous interface. The model results from vertical averaging and contains several unknown parameters. We perform surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices to investigate the sensitivity of the model to variations of physical parameters for two test cases: filtration and splitting flows. However, constructing surrogates for higher-dimensional random fields requires either many training runs or sophisticated sampling strategies. To address this, we compare polynomial chaos surrogates, including sparse and multi-resolution representations, for their efficiency in global sensitivity analysis, using a predefined Sobol' sequence of training samples. Across the tested cases, multi-resolution approach delivers the most accurate estimation of Sobol' indices."}

A convergence analysis of the fully discrete scheme is conducted under suitable regularity assumptions, confirming optimal-order convergence in both time and space for the phase variable, chemical potential, and auxiliary variable in the H1-norm. Furthermore, the scheme is proven to be unconditionally energy stable. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and to confirm the theoretical convergence rates."}

Several recent contributions have highlighted the potential of this approach in both static and dynamic frameworks. However, a major limitation remains the high computational cost. Two main strategies have been identified to mitigate this issue: the use of locally refined meshes and the adoption of higher-order models. In this work, leveraging Truncated Hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines), we introduce adaptive simulations of higher-order phase-field formulations (AT1 and AT2), focusing primarily on two-dimensional fracture problems."}

In the case of plates, transverse shear locking is most prominent, for shells several other types of locking exist. A common cure are mixed methods that introduce additional fields of unknowns into the variational formulation. These fields reduce constraints and thus alleviate locking significantly. As a drawback, the discretized additional fields increase computational costs significantly. These fields are often eliminated by static condensation, which requires the inverse of a part of the stiffness matrix. In Lagrange-based finite elements, this inverse is computed on element level, due to a discontinuous interpolation of additional fields. Since isogeometric analysis features higher continuity, static condensation must be performed on patch level, which requires a costly matrix inversion on that level. In this contribution, the virtual shear parameters of a mixed isogeometric plate formulation are interpolated by enhanced approximate dual basis functions. This allows to conduct row-sum lumping of the relevant matrix part at a minimal loss of accuracy, since this part becomes diagonal dominant. For a properly chosen integration space, this lumped matrix becomes the identity matrix. Thus, the proposed condensation procedure does not require an inversion anymore. The crucial and novel point is the proposed treatment of knot vectors with limited internal continuity. With the help of several single- and multi-patch examples, both with full and with limited internal continuity, we show that the proposed procedure obtains optimal error convergence rates in all cases, while without these alterations, convergence rates are significantly deteriorated."}

In this paper, we address this long-standing controversy using high-resolution numerical simulations on $8192^2$ and $1536^3$ grids. We show that the total energy and cross helicity spectra are closer to $k^{-5/3}$ than $k^{-3/2}$. The fluxes and structure functions of the total energy and cross helicity also demonstrate robust support for Kolmogorov scaling. The magnetic energy shows $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum, but the kinetic energy exhibits $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum; the latter spectrum is due to the energy transfers from the magnetic field to the velocity field."}

Although adjusted TALYS-2.0 outputs show marked improvements in agreement with experimental data over the default parameters, the procedure is generally time-consuming due to the need for sequential TALYS-2.0 calculations. Since the models and model parameters must be defined and constrained prior to adjustment, we show in this work that an artificial neural network can serve as a surrogate model to successfully predict TALYS-2.0 outputs within this domain of input parameters. No practical differences were observed in the trained model's performance between uniform random, Latin hypercube and Sobol sequence sampling for generating the training datasets. Once validated, trained neural network models were used to adjust TALYS-2.0 nuclear model parameters, where a multi-parameter fitting procedure was not only feasible but optimal for this process. The neural network approach is >1000x faster at generating residual product cross sections than using TALYS-2.0 directly, and a high-fidelity surrogate model could be implemented with about 1500 TALYS-2.0 files to achieve adjusted cross sections comparable to the previous publication."}

Our approach decomposes principal Koopman eigenfunctions into linear and nonlinear components, where the linear part is obtained from the system's linearization and the nonlinear part is computed by solving a partial differential equation using symmetric kernel collocation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The resulting Lyapunov function is constructed as a quadratic form in the approximate eigenfunctions. We establish error bounds relating the approximation quality to the fill distance of collocation points and provide a certification procedure using continuous piecewise affine (CPA) methods. Numerical experiments on benchmark systems, including a polynomial system and the Duffing oscillator, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

We report the first experimental observation of passive freeze-out of RMI in a low-pressure surrogate regime; an instability stagnation effect induced without modifying the driving pressure pulse or the target surface geometry. Using additively manufactured sub-surface voids in a sinusoidal target, we convert a single shock into a sequence of weaker shocks that suppress instability growth upstream of the surface by over 70%. High-speed X-ray imaging and hydrodynamic simulations suggest that this suppression arises primarily from temporal shaping, with lesser contributions from spatial curvature and shock weakening. Our results demonstrate a driver-independent pathway for controlling shock-driven hydrodynamic instabilities relevant to ICF and other high energy density systems."}

While this problem is now well-understood, determining the escape time for a particle that must exit through a narrow tube has proven challenging. Indeed, relying on analogies with electrodynamics, parameter fits to simulations, and heuristics, a variety of conflicting estimates for this escape time have been offered over the last three decades, some of which are counterintuitive and arguably non-physical. In this paper, we combine matched asymptotic analysis and probabilistic methods to determine the exact asymptotics of the narrow escape time through a tube. We obtain a new escape time formula which reduces to the various prior estimates in certain special cases. If the diffusivity in the tube differs from the diffusivity in the rest of the domain, our results reveal the importance of the form of the multiplicative noise inherent to any diffusivity that varies in space. We discuss our results in the context of asymmetric cell division."}
