One way to take advantage of the spatial and temporal traits believed to characterize the solution is to encode them into the entries of a dictionary, and to seek the solution as a sparse linear combination of the dictionary atoms. To promote a vector of coefficients with mostly vanishing entries, we consider a stochastic extension of the dictionary coding problem model with a random hierarchical sparsity promoting prior. We compute the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the coefficient vector using the Iterative Alternating Sequential Algorithm (IAS), which has been demonstrated to efficiently solve inverse problems with minimal need for parameter tuning. The proposed methodology is tested on real-world dynamic Computed Tomography and MRI datasets, where it is compared to the popular Alternating Direction Method of Minimizers (ADMM). The computed examples show the that proposed methodology is competitive with the ADMM for compressed sensing, with a significantly lower sensitivity to hyper-parameter selection."}

To address these difficulties, we employ a boundary integral formulation thereby avoiding volumetric discretization. In this framework, the accuracy of the numerical solution depends strongly on how the material interfaces are discretized. In this work, we demonstrate that standard meshing strategies based on resolving the maximum wavenumber across the domain become computationally inefficient in multilayered configurations, where high wavenumbers are confined to localized subdomains. Through a systematic study of multilayer transmission problems, we show that no simple discretization rule based on the maximum wavenumber or material contrasts emerges. Instead, the wavenumber of the background (exterior) medium plays a dominant role in determining the optimal boundary resolution. Building on these insights, we propose an adaptive approach that achieves uniform accuracy and efficient computation across multiple layers. Numerical experiments for a range of multilayer configurations demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the proposed approach."}

Armed with integration by parts in the reverse form we provide an elementary derivation of an exact error represenation of Hermite quadrature rule. This approach possesses several advantages over the classical approaches: i) Only integration by parts is needed for the derivation; ii) the error representation requires much milder regularity, namely the existence of nth-order derivative rather than a (2n)th-order derivative of the function under consideration. As a result, our error formula is valid for less regular functions for which the classical ones are not valid; iii) our approach rediscovers Legendre polynomials and more interestingly it provides a surprisingly elegant relation between Legendre polynomial and Hermite interpolation. In particular, Legendre polynomials are precisely the error kernels for interpolatory Hermite quadrature rules; and iv) We also rediscover the Rodrigues formula for Legendre polynomials as part of our findings. For those who are interested in a different proof of the exact error representation for Hermite quadrature rule, we provide an alternative proof using the Peano kernel theorem. We also provide a composite interpolatory Hermite quadrature rule for practical applications."}

Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) offers an attractive data-driven reduction framework, but its operators are trained for a single set of reservoir properties. When permeability or well location changes, conventional practice is to regenerate snapshots and retrain the surrogate, erasing most of the speed advantage. This work presents a lightweight alternative that updates an existing DMD or DMD-with-control model without incorporating new simulation data or retraining. Two complementary update strategies are introduced. For cases where permeability changes uniformly across the domain, the proposed updates adjust the models internal dynamics and control response to match the new flow timescale. When permeability varies in space, the approach modifies the spatial representation so that high-permeability zones are given greater influence on the models reduced basis. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed updates recover plume migration and pressure build-up within three percent of a freshly trained surrogate yet execute hundreds of times faster than full retraining. These methods therefore enable real-time optimization and rapid what-if studies while preserving the physical fidelity demanded by carbon-storage workflows."}

This provides a foundational framework for computing isometric embeddings of Riemannian manifolds into Euclidean space, with the goal of extending it to a broader range of cases and applications in the future.

In this work we describe the IBSC framework in a comprehensive manner and show how variations such as using dynamic voltage mappings and quadratic-program constrained control fit naturally into the framework.

We pay special attention to the challenge of decoupling the interaction between shape control and vertical control, which was a source of degraded vertical control performance on NSTX-U. This work is intended to provide a systematic overview of IBSC, and to that end, we have provided background material, proposed design procedures, and tutorials on the magnetic control design process within the appendices. Applying the systematic design procedure to NSTX-U, we find that the vertical control bobble on NSTX-U can be removed via decoupling, and that the vertical control phase margin can be improved by 6 degrees just by including PF1A and PF2 as vertical actuators."}

The smallest magnetic gradient scale length on the LCFS - denoted L_gradB - has been shown to be a good proxy for minimum coil-surface distance in optimizations of a current potential on a winding surface, such as through the REGCOIL method. However, it has not been shown the same is true for filament coils, or that the magnetic gradient scale length is an effective objective function in optimization. In this paper, we explore examples in which min(L_gradB) is correlated with the minimum coil-surface distance for filament coils. First, we analyze a subset of the single-stage-optimized equilibria from the QUASR dataset [Giuliani et al. JPP (2024)]. We find that the majority of configurations have min(L_gradB) located nearby the point of closest coil-surface distance. Second, we optimize quasihelically symmetric equilibria to have improved min(L_gradB), and optimize coils via a continuation method. We then traced alpha particles to test confinement. Finally, we compare min(L_gradB) to the minimum coil-surface distance with filament coils optimized for a set of finite beta equilibria with random boundary shapes. For all datasets, we find that min(L_gradB) is correlated with both the minimum coil-surface and coil-coil distances if sufficient coil length is allowed. Even when there is a trade-off with proxies for confinement, optimizing for improved min(L_gradB) can result in better confinement in the presence of coils, up to a point. This is because - when holding coil-coil distance constant - equilibria with lower min(L_gradB) have a larger normal field error dominated by coil ripple causing particle loss. Both can be reduced by increasing coil-surface distance for equilibria with a high min(L_gradB)."}

These inputs propagate through multi-step rollouts via a discrete Grönwall recursion with amplification governed by the average-strain exponent rather than a worst-case Lipschitz constant. On the qualitative side, sampler-native path controls yield LM time regularity; together with uniform energy and structure-function bounds this gives precompactness in $d_T$ and strong convergence of LM-admissible observables. If hierarchy residuals vanish along a sequence, every limit is an LM statistical solution, with residuals bounded by training-native drift/score regression errors. Finally, we show how common finite-grid diagnostics--proper distributional scores and likelihood-style certificates--admit principled interpretations as resolved observables within the same statistical-solution framework."}

We consider three strategies to reduce Trotter error by orbital transformation: (i) The a priori selection of an orbital basis that produces low Trotter error. (ii) The derivation of an orbital basis that produces a ground state energy free of Trotter error (as we observed that the Trotter error is a continuous function in the Givens-rotation parameter, from which continuity of this error upon orbital transformation can be deduced).

In the pedestal, gradient length scales are much shorter and are measured to be of the order of the ion poloidal gyroradius. We present an extension of neoclassical theory that is applicable in transport barriers of large aspect ratio tokamaks. We show that particle and momentum transport are connected in such a way that a source of parallel momentum can drive a significant neoclassical ion particle flux. In strong gradient regions, density, electric potential, mean parallel flow, and ion temperature are shown to no longer be flux functions. Instead, they have a small but important poloidally varying piece that modifies the transport equations to lowest order.

We first conduct a systematic analysis of the existence and geometric properties of steady-state solutions for all $m>0$, revealing a critical threshold $m^*=(d+2)/(d-2)$ for variational compactness and solution structure. For $0 < m < m^*$, we then prove that, under natural regularity constraints, radially decreasing steady states coincide with both the extremals of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality and the global minimizers of the free energy. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of such steady states for $m \\neq 1 + 2/d$. Furthermore, in the supercritical regime $1 + 2/d < m < m^*$, we identify a sharp threshold given by the $L^{m+1}$ norm of the unique radial steady-state solution, which distinguishes between global existence for initial data below the threshold and finite-time blow-up for initial data above the threshold. The main contribution of this work is to use steady-state solutions as a theoretical pivot to construct a unified analytical framework that connects parameter classification, variational structure and dynamic behavior. This framework elucidates how the regularity barrier prevents infinite energy descent and selects stable equilibrium states, and thus predicts the global evolution of the system, thereby providing a unified variational principle for understanding steady-state selection and dynamic bifurcations in such higher-order degenerate diffusion equations."}

While many existing methods can compute approximate eigenpairs with sufficiently small backward errors, the magnitude of the resulting forward errors is often unknown. Consequently, when high-precision numerical solutions are required, the computational cost tends to increase significantly because backward errors must be reduced to an excessive degree. To address this issue, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm that aims to achieve a prescribed forward error, together with a high-accuracy numerical algorithm based on the Ozaki scheme -- an emulation technique for matrix multiplication -- adapted to this problem. Since the proposed method is not primarily focused on reducing backward errors, the computational cost can be significantly reduced. Finally, we present numerical experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method."}

In this work, we develop THEMIS code, a fully three dimensional (3D) multiphysics model of helicon wave propagation and power deposition in a toroidal fusion relevant configuration, employing a finite temperature thermal dielectric tensor. The code quantifies the relative contributions of Doppler shifted cyclotron damping, anomalous Doppler damping, collisional damping, and Landau damping, and demonstrates that slow wave propagation and electron Landau damping dominate the accessible heating regime in Helimak device. A comparative study of four planar antenna geometries under the present protruding window configuration shows that geometric cutoffs and SOL density gradients severely limit power penetration into the core accessible region. To address this constraint, we introduce a recessed window launch scheme that positions the dielectric window inside the vacuum vessel and perform systematic parameter scans of window position, antenna geometry, and installation orientation. From these analyses, we identify the key physics driven principles governing efficient helicon wave coupling: the importance of open circuit termination, maximized strap length and width, controlled inter turn spacing, and sufficient clearance from metallic walls to avoid near field suppression. Guided by these principles, we designed an optimized racetrack spiral antenna that increases coupling efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared with conventional short circuited rectangular spiral antenna."}

Global electrostatic gyrokinetic simulations show that this modification to the radial density profile due to gas injection suppresses the existing trapped electron mode (TEM). Simulation results show that the TEM-dominated turbulence suppression reduces the turbulence-driven heat transport, leading to an increase in core temperature.

Complete descriptions of the error behavior are provided for these techniques. In particular, the relationship between the intermediate results at two consecutive summing steps is provided, which is used to identify the operation that limits accuracy and guide the design of more nuanced techniques.

In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes.

The amplification of chorus in Earth's magnetosphere has been the subject of intense scientific inquiry since the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts in 1958. Resonant interactions between chorus and radiation belt electrons can lead to the exponential growth of small seed waves by a factor of fifty within milliseconds. These powerful modes can cause rapid acceleration of electrons and endanger space-based technologies. Recent efforts to understand chorus amplification have drawn upon parallels to free-electron lasers, laboratory devices that generate intense coherent light with tunable frequencies. This approach, known as the free-electron laser model of magnetospheric chorus, is the subject of this dissertation. In this work, we build on previous research on the free-electron laser model, ultimately presenting a novel nonlinear model of whistler-mode chorus in the magnetosphere. In the first chapter, we provide a brief introduction to whistlers, magnetospheric chorus, and free-electron lasers. We also derive the 2N+2 equations foundational to the interaction of chorus with N resonant electrons. In the second chapter, we derive a reduced set of just three nonlinear equations using the method of collective variables. We then derive a Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for the behavior of a chorus wave packet with a spectrum of frequencies with spatially varying amplitudes and discuss the prediction of solitary chorus waves. In the third chapter, we focus on the behavior of the single-mode solutions predicted by the GLE, including their linear stability and the phenomenon of mode condensation, where a single mode can emerge from a noisy spectrum.

This scarcity significantly hinders our understanding of the role of plasmoids in the reconnection process from an observational perspective. Using high-spatiotemporal multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we traced the entire evolution of a coronal {plasma sheet}. Its formation was driven by the emergence of photospheric magnetic flux, followed by tearing, and eventual decay. The evolution of the {plasma sheet} exhibited two distinct stages. Initially, it rose rapidly, lengthened, and underwent tearing at a low frequency. Subsequently, its ascent slowed, it began to shorten, and the tearing occurred more frequently. Detailed analysis of the reconnecting {plasma sheet} focuses on heating, plasmoid dynamics (formation and ejection), and the resulting reconnection rate change. Two key heating processes are identified: {plasma sheet} tearing and coalescence involving plasmoids and magnetic cusps. More importantly, combining observations with analytical studies suggests that plasmoids are key carriers of magnetic flux fast transferring in the observed torn {plasma sheet}, and their formation and ejection significantly enhance the reconnection rate and facilitate the onset of fast reconnection."}

We show that a data-driven Langevin-type stochastic closure restores the correct timing and magnitude of variance growth across scales, demonstrating that sustained stochasticity is essential for predictability in reduced turbulent dynamics."}

An all-optical scheme based on plasma-based acceleration to produce bright electron beams that are pre-bunched on nanometer-scales is proposed. By using a density modulation created by two low intensity counter-propagating lasers, the phase velocity of the plasma wake excited by an intense driver laser in a uniform plasma can be modulated at a frequency twice that of the colliding lasers and thus turn the injection on and off. The injected electrons are micro-bunched at the Doppler shifted wavelength of the modulated wavelength using the corresponding phase velocity of the gradual expansion of the wakefield. It is demonstrated that by controlling the properties of the drive and colliding lasers, that beams with exotic pre-bunched structures can be produced, which may have critical applications in ultrafast high power x-rays. This extremely compact, all-optical scheme to produce ultra-bright pre-bunched electron beams may therefore enable novel applications for ultrafast x-ray users and arouse general interest in various fields."}

To determine the phase stability, we previously developed a procedure to compute the harmonic free energy as a function of temperature, which was suited for CsPbI$_3$ but fails when Cs is replaced by organic cations due to their rotational freedom. Herein we propose a multistep thermodynamic integration (TI) approach that corrects the harmonic free energy to obtain the Gibbs free energy. Given the abundance of local minima in these materials, we employ replica exchange to prevent simulations from getting trapped, while introducing an intermediate potential energy surface to improve convergence and reduce computational cost. Benchmarking energy and forces from different exchange-correlation functionals and dispersion methods against high-level RPA+HF calculations identifies PBE+D3(BJ) as the best trade-off between accuracy, computational efficiency, and precision. To perform molecular dynamics simulations within the TI framework, it was necessary to train a machine learning potential using the MACE architecture on ab initio data calculated with density functional theory. Our results show that, for all three materials, the free energy difference between the $γ$ and $δ$ phases exhibits a very similar temperature dependence. This suggests that phase stability is primarily governed by differences in ground-state energy, rather than by material-specific thermal effects. Beyond these three materials, our methodology provides a robust framework for investigating the phase behavior of other MHPs, paving the way for the discovery of more stable perovskites."}

We compare unperturbed accretion with a case featuring plasma density bubbles with pressure balanced magnetic islands of different amplitudes. Power spectrum analysis of accretion time series, performed via the Blackman-Tukey method, shows that the perturbed case exhibits (1) steeper spectral indices compared to the unperturbed case, deviating from the characteristic $1/ω$ noise spectrum, and (2) increased correlation times, providing evidence for absorption of macro-structures at the event horizon.

We investigate the scaling of $Δ$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $Δ$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $Δ\\propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity."}

By decomposing the domain into an assembly of 1D directional components matched along their entire boundaries, the method inherently enforces the continuity of all variational parameters, including second-order (curvature) and third-order (shear) derivatives.

We prove that constant-depth networks equipped with smooth activations automatically exploit arbitrarily high orders of target function smoothness, achieving the minimax-optimal approximation and estimation error rates (up to logarithmic factors). In sharp contrast, networks with non-smooth activations, such as ReLU, lack this adaptivity: their attainable approximation order is strictly limited by depth, and capturing higher-order smoothness requires proportional depth growth. These results identify activation smoothness as a fundamental mechanism, alternative to depth, for attaining statistical optimality. Technically, our results are established via a constructive approximation framework that produces explicit neural network approximators with carefully controlled parameter norms and model size. This complexity control ensures statistical learnability under empirical risk minimization (ERM) and removes the impractical sparsity constraints commonly required in prior analyses."}

To resolve this analytic bottleneck, we introduce distribution functions and decreasing rearrangements, culminating in the construction of Lorentz spaces ($L_{p, q}$). By utilizing the Complex (Riesz-Thorin) and Real (Peetre's K-functional) methods of interpolation, these highly sensitive intermediate spaces act as geometric bridges between endpoint extremes.

Here, we are motivated by recent experiments in which cell aggregates were observed to behave as active droplets during collective migration along chemical gradients, or chemotaxis. To understand this process, we develop a minimal model of a growing thin active droplet driven by a self-generated chemical gradient. In broad agreement with the experiments, dynamic simulations reveal that chemotacting droplets exhibit proliferation-driven morphological transitions. To fully characterise these transitions, we perform a multiple scales analysis to show that the droplet dynamics follow a sequence of travelling wave solutions defined by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem parametrised by the slowly increasing droplet volume. Our analysis reveals that morphological transitions can occur continuously or through a discontinuous bifurcation. Further asymptotic analysis of the travelling wave problem reveals that these morphological transitions arise from exponentially small (\"beyond-all-orders\") asymptotic terms that originate from the rear and front contact lines. Moreover, we show that the nature of the transitions is fully determined by two key dimensionless parameters, which quantify the internal stress balance within the droplet and the strength of the coupling between the droplet migration dynamics and the external chemical field. Overall, our results provide a complete characterisation of the morphodynamics of a class of migrating active thin droplets, with implications in a range of biological systems where cell aggregates exhibit fluid-like behaviour."}

By contrast, on Euclidean or hyperbolic manifolds, the equations are always solvable, with all expected properties of solutions satisfied. These findings support the view that, although the conformal method appears to present some drawbacks on compact manifolds, it remains a promising tool for parametrizing solutions to the constraint equations on asymptotically flat and hyperbolic manifolds in arbitrary mean curvature regimes.\n  In this article, we also investigate the sign of mass, showing that the ADM and asymptotically hyperbolic mass can take arbitrary sign when the decay rate of symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor $k$ at infinity is critical. Finally, most solution classes in our framework are explicit, providing a variety of models in general relativity and offering insights into the structure and behavior of initial data, particularly in numerical applications."}

This solves problems posed by Hsiang-Lawson and Hsiang-Hsiang. The equivariance reduces the minimal surface equation to an ODE, and we prove the existence of capillary minimal cones for every contact angle. We obtain free-boundary solutions as limits of capillary surfaces via a singular shooting problem with infinite initial slope. As the contact angle degenerates to $0$, rescalings of the capillary cones converge to a homogeneous solution of the one-phase Bernoulli problem, further illustrating the connection between one-phase free boundaries and minimal surfaces through the capillary functional."}
