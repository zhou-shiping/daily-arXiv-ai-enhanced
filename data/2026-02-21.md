Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoNumerics is a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for PDEs from natural language descriptions, generating transparent solvers grounded in classical numerical analysis rather than black-box neural approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solver design requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning, while recent neural network approaches are computationally expensive and lack interpretability. There's a need for accessible, automated PDE solving that maintains transparency and interpretability.

Method: Multi-agent framework with coarse-to-fine execution strategy and residual-based self-verification mechanism. The system autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers directly from natural language PDE descriptions, generating transparent solvers based on classical numerical analysis principles.

Result: Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems show AutoNumerics achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing neural and LLM-based baselines. The framework correctly selects numerical schemes based on PDE structural properties.

Conclusion: AutoNumerics demonstrates viability as an accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving, offering transparent, interpretable solvers that bridge the gap between traditional numerical analysis and modern AI approaches.

Abstract: PDEs are central to scientific and engineering modeling, yet designing accurate numerical solvers typically requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning. Recent neural network-based approaches improve flexibility but often demand high computational cost and suffer from limited interpretability. We introduce \texttt{AutoNumerics}, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for general PDEs directly from natural language descriptions. Unlike black-box neural solvers, our framework generates transparent solvers grounded in classical numerical analysis. We introduce a coarse-to-fine execution strategy and a residual-based self-verification mechanism. Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems demonstrate that \texttt{AutoNumerics} achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing neural and LLM-based baselines, and correctly selects numerical schemes based on PDE structural properties, suggesting its viability as an accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving.

### [2] [Universal Fine-Grained Symmetry Inference and Enforcement for Rigorous Crystal Structure Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17176)
*Shi Yin,Jinming Mu,Xudong Zhu,Lixin He*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: A new crystal structure prediction method using LLMs to generate Wyckoff patterns with constrained optimization for symmetry consistency, achieving SOTA performance without database reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning CSP methods treat symmetry as soft heuristics or rely on known structure templates, limiting physical fidelity and ability to discover genuinely new materials.

Method: Uses LLMs to encode chemical semantics and generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, with constrained-optimization search enforcing algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and stoichiometry, integrated into diffusion backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks with superior matching performance, enabling exploration of uncharted materials space.

Conclusion: Establishes new paradigm for rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space without reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge.

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP), which aims to predict the three-dimensional atomic arrangement of a crystal from its composition, is central to materials discovery and mechanistic understanding. Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space. This framework enables efficient expansion into previously uncharted materials space, eliminating reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge.
