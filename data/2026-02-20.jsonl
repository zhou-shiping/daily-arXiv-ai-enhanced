The proposed approach is based on a nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) that satisfies the summation-by-parts (SBP) property. At the semidiscrete level, entropy stability is established through the SBP structure and the discrete metric identities associated with curvilinear coordinate mappings. By incorporating entropy-stable numerical fluxes at element interfaces, a global discrete entropy inequality is obtained. To further control nonphysical oscillations near strong discontinuities, the entropy-stable DG formulation is combined with a modified oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) method, which was originally proposed in [59]. We observe that the zero-order damping coefficient in the original OEDG method naturally serves as an effective shock indicator, which enables localization of the oscillation control mechanism and significantly reduces computational cost. Moreover, while the original OEDG formulation relies on local orthogonal modal bases and is primarily restricted to simplicial meshes, we reformulate the OE procedure using projection operators, allowing for a systematic extension to general curvilinear meshes. The resulting method preserves conservation and entropy stability while effectively suppressing spurious oscillations. A series of challenging numerical experiments is presented to demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed entropy-stable OEDG method on both Cartesian and curvilinear meshes."}

A Lorentz boost converts isotropic rest-frame noise into correlated electric and magnetic fields, producing a gain-independent fluctuation observable that yields the drift velocity purely from stochastic data. Combined with angle-resolved noise spectra governed by the covariant fluctuation--dissipation theorem, this enables full reconstruction of $β^μ$ using electromagnetic measurements alone. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates percent-level accuracy at realistic signal-to-noise ratios, and feasibility estimates indicate sub-microsecond integration times for laboratory plasmas.

While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of \"distilled\" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.\n  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model \"superclusters\", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts."}

These beams are then translated across the object to bring different regions of interest into focus. The Fourier diffraction relation adapted to this setting differs in one crucial point from the plane-wave case: while certain Fourier coefficients of the measurements still directly correspond to individual Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential, others are given by linear combinations of two Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential.\n  This article investigates which Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential can be uniquely recovered from these relations.

Hot electrons that would otherwise escape the corona and lead to capsule charging in unmagnetized implosions are confined in a mirror-mode of the magnetic field in magnetized implosions. These hot electrons are shown to subsequently pitch-angle scatter from the mirror onto the capsule, thereby leading to the observed hard x-ray generation in magnetized implosions.

Although recent studies have demonstrated the excitation of plasma wakefields using high-power microwave pulses in plasma-filled waveguides, the conditions required for efficient electron acceleration in such configurations remain insufficiently characterized. In this work, we investigate the acceleration of externally injected electrons by microwave-driven plasma wakefields in rectangular waveguides filled with low-density plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are employed to analyze the dynamics of electron injection and energy gain under both reduced and fully self-consistent numerical models. The results show that electron acceleration is strongly dependent on the injection phase and initial velocity. Optimal acceleration is achieved when electrons are pre-accelerated to velocities close to the group velocity of the driving microwave pulse. For the parameters considered, energy gains of the order of $10^2 \\mathrm{keV}$ are obtained over interaction lengths of the order of meters, while maintaining a quasi-monoenergetic energy distribution under suitable injection conditions. The influence of transverse dynamics and space-charge effects is also examined, revealing additional constraints on acceleration efficiency associated with the transverse electromagnetic field of the driving microwave pulse. These results provide a quantitative assessment of the acceleration stage in microwave-driven plasma wakefield schemes and support their evaluation as a viable platform for compact plasma-based accelerators."}

Past studies using the ten-moment fluid model to capture important kinetic physics such as the electron inertia and full representation of the pressure tensor proved advantageous to a two-fluid representation of reconnection, but the model struggled when using a local relaxation closure for the heat flux to replicate the current sheet instabilities and subsequent mixing seen in kinetic simulations.

Although effective in practice, its mathematical structure and potential for parallelization have remained unexplored. In this work, we establish a rigorous functional-analytic foundation for the TV-Stokes model. We formulate both steps in appropriate infinite-dimensional function spaces, derive their dual formulations, and analyze the compatibility and mathematical consistency of the coupled system. In particular, we identify analytical inconsistencies in the original formulation and demonstrate how an alternative model resolves them. We also examine the orthogonal projection onto the divergence-free subspace, proving its existence in a continuous setting and establishing consistency with its discrete counterpart.\n  Building on this theoretical framework, we develop the first domain decomposition method for TV-Stokes by applying overlapping Schwarz-type iterations to the duals of both steps. Although the divergence-free constraint gives rise to a global projection operator in the continuous model, we show that it becomes locally computable in the discrete setting. This insight enables a fully parallelizable algorithm suitable for large-scale image processing in memory-constrained environments. Numerical experiments demonstrate the correctness of the domain decomposition approach and its usability in parallel image reconstruction."}

We perform high-resolution two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations using a finite-Larmor-radius shear-flow initial configuration. Plasma mixing is quantified using particle tracking, passive tracers, and diagnostics of magnetic reconnection. Mixing across the shear layer is present but localized, occurring mainly in narrow interface regions and plasma structures. Ions mix more effectively than electrons, which remain largely frozen to field lines. Enhanced mixing correlates with localized reconnection within and between KH vortices. Cross-boundary transport driven by the kinetic KHI is highly localized and mediated by vortex advection and reconnection.

While physical aggression is prototypical, contemporary societies increasingly debate whether exclusion, humiliation, online harassment or symbolic acts should be classified within the same moral category. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) are being consulted in everyday contexts to interpret and label complex social behaviors. Whether these systems reproduce, reshape or simplify human conceptions of violence remains an open question. Methods: Here we present a systematic comparison between human judgements and LLM classifications across 22 scenarios carefully designed to be morally dividing, spanning from physical and verbally aggressive behavior, relational dynamics, marginalization, symbolic actions and verbal expressions. Human responses were compared with outputs from multiple instruction-tuned models of varying sizes and architectures. We conducted global, sentence-level and thematic-domain analyses, and examined variability across models to assess patterns of convergence and divergence. Findings: This study treats violence as a strategically chosen proxy through which broader belief formation dynamics can be observed. Violence is not the focus of the study, but it serves as a tool to investigate broader analysis. It enables a structured investigation of how LLMs operationalize ambiguous moral constructs, negotiate conceptual boundaries, and transform plural human interpretations into singular outputs. More broadly, the findings contribute to ongoing debates about the epistemic role of conversational AI in shaping everyday interpretations of harm, responsibility and social norms, highlighting the importance of transparency and critical engagement as these systems increasingly mediate public reasoning."}

However, at atomic scales and outside the range of their applicability, the AL/LL equations fail and RR destroys the coherent state of an electron-undermining the very concept of a RR force. This process can be described by the coupled Schrödinger-Maxwell (SM) system under appropriate limits, but the system's nonlinear complexity has long limited purely analytical studies. We present geometric structure-preserving algorithms for the SM system that preserve gauge invariance, symplecticity, and unitarity on the discrete space-time lattice, which are implemented in our Structure-Preserving scHrodINger maXwell (SPHINX) code. By constructing coherent states from the Landau levels, SPHINX simulates the fully-coupled nonlinear dynamics of an electron coherent state, the energy partition evolution, and decoherence/relaxation of the electron wave packet in time due to RR. These simulations indicate that, in an external magnetic field, an electron prepared in an atomic-scale coherent state can radiate strongly, rapidly losing coherence and dispersing into a decoherent wave packet. Additionally, we also present the fully-coupled nonlinear evolution of the non-degenerate ground- and first-excited Landau levels themselves to understand how the coupled SM system modifies the well-known ideal (i.e., Schrödinger-only) dynamics of the Landau Levels. With appropriate boundary conditions, simulations show that the Landau levels are renormalized into stationary dressed eigenstates with constant electromagnetic and kinetic energies. This opens a new computational window into RR physics and advances modeling of extreme-field phenomena in fusion plasmas, astrophysics, and next-generation laser experiments"}

At its heart lies the exchange-correlation functional, a quantity which exactly encapsulates the many-body effects stemming from the quantum mechanical interactions between the electrons. Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications. Over the past six decades, hundreds of density functional approximations have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency.\n  This review surveys the theoretical foundations of semi-local functionals, including local density approximations, generalized gradient approximations, and meta-generalized gradient approximations. We provide a comprehensive, consistently organized discussion that consolidates both historical developments and recent advances in this field. Beginning with the essential concepts of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we present the construction principles of semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Special attention is given to the physical motivations underlying functional development, the mathematical properties that guide their construction, and the practical considerations that determine their applicability across different chemical and physical systems.\n  This work is intended to serve as both a introduction for newcomers to the field and a comprehensive reference for practitioners. By consolidating the extensive literature on semi-local functionals and providing a unified framework for understanding their construction and application, we aim to facilitate further developments in density functional approximations and their use in tackling the diverse challenges of modern computational chemistry and condensed matter physics."}

When rescaling the thin domain, isotropic interaction ranges naturally become anisotropic, leading to the development of a theory for anisotropic nonlocal gradients with direction-dependent interaction ranges. Unlike existing nonlocal derivatives with finite horizon, which are defined via interaction kernels supported on balls of positive radius, our formulation is based on ellipsoidal interaction regions whose principal radii may vanish independently. This yields a unified framework that interpolates between fully nonlocal, partially nonlocal, and purely local models. Employing these tools, we present a $Γ$-convergence analysis for the nonlocal thin-film energies. The limit functional retains the structural form of the classical membrane energy, and the classical local model is recovered precisely when all interaction radii vanish."}

Proton-driven accelerators in particular have the potential to bring particles to high energy in a single stage. In the quasilinear regime - where the plasma wake is only partially evacuated - a witness bunch of electrons drives a cavitated wake, which acts to preserve the emittance of the portion of the witness inside this self-blowout. In the case of a misalignment between the driver and witness, this behaviour can persist, but its effectiveness is reduced. In this paper, we study transverse witness dynamics in this regime, and develop analytical models to describe the witness motion, and develop a metric to estimate emittance preservation based on a single parameter which estimates the density of the witness after phase mixing. Particle in cell simulations using the AWAKE Run 2c baseline parameters show excellent agreement with the predictive models developed.

Motivated by this behavior, we propose a source-compensated, history-dependent helicity density that satisfies an exact local balance identity by construction, enabling Saffman-type two-point correlation integrals which, under standard flux-decorrelation assumptions, can exhibit intermediate-scale plateaus that are roughly time-independent. In our simulations we demonstrate such plateaus to remain approximately invariant even as the usual Saffman helicity integral plateau value $I_H$ evolves during the early kinetic stage. Under approximate single-scale self-similarity, the plateau behavior of the magnetic integral is consistent with the 2D decay constraint $BL \\sim \\text{const}$.

In this study, we carry out a statistical analysis of the properties of compressible fluctuations in solar wind dominated by balanced and imbalanced turbulence. Using in-situ measurements from Wind, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe, we investigate the scale dependence of density and magnetic field fluctuations and their correlations with plasma beta and radial distance. Our results indicate that solar wind compressibility is likely affected by both expansion effects and compressible dynamics governed by local plasma conditions. The non-Alfvenic wind is dominated by anti-correlated fluctuations, whereas the Alfvenic wind contains a mixture of correlated and anti-correlated fluctuations, though the latter remain prevalent. While the anti-correlated component is consistent with MHD slow magnetosonic modes, the correlated (fast mode-like) component is not reproduced by predictions from either linear MHD theory or nonlinear models of forced compressible fluctuations. Nevertheless, the dominant slow mode component explains the observed dependence on beta and the enhanced density fluctuations measured by Parker Solar Probe. This further suggests that slow mode waves contribute significantly to the compressible energy budget near the Sun and may play an important role in solar wind heating and acceleration close to the Sun."}

In the bounded domain setting and for magnetic fields of moderate strengths, we prove that among all simply-connected smooth domains of given area, the disk maximises the lowest magnetic Steklov eigenvalue. For exterior domains, we establish a similar isoperimetric inequality for magnetic fields of moderate strength under fixed perimeter constraint and additional geometric and symmetry assumptions. The proofs rely on the method of torsion-type trial functions in the bounded domain case and on the method of trial functions dependent only on the distance to the boundary in the exterior domain case."}

The proof is inspired by the techniques developed for the two-dimensional mass-critical NLS equation in a similar context by Martel-Raphaël [37]. The main difficulty originates from the fact that the unstable directions related to scaling are excited by the nonlinear interactions. To overcome this difficulty, a refined approximate solution that involves some non-localized profiles is needed. In particular, a sharp understanding for the interactions between solitons and such profiles is also required."}

The estimates we provide exhibit a clear dependence on the potential and the Lévy measure defining the kinetic term operator, and they yield a description of the semigroups' action on $L^1$ in terms of Orlicz spaces. Our framework is quite general, encompassing fractional and relativistic Laplacians as kinetic operators.

To handle the discrepancy between the regularity structures of the approximate and the limiting equations, we consider models that lift $0$ noises to nontrivial models, in analogy with ``pure area'' from rough paths.

We show that the Hopf algebra of multi-indices does not satisfy the cocycle condition.

The drift of the equation is singular and covers the typical logarithmic Flory-Huggins potential required in phase-separation dynamics. We prove well-posedness of the model in a strong probabilistic sense, and analyze its long-time behavior in terms of existence and uniqueness of invariant measures, ergodicity, and mixing properties. Eventually, we present an Euler--Maruyama scheme to simulate the model and illustrate how it captures fundamental biological phenomena, such as damage clustering, stress-induced topology perturbations, and damage dynamics."}

However, when dealing with optimal control problems of stochastic Volterra integral equations (SVIEs) with completely monotone kernels, deep mathematical difficulties arise and it is still not understood. These very classical problems have applications in most fields and have now become even more popular due to their applications in mathematical finance under rough volatility. In this article, we consider a class of optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. Via a recent Markovian lift \\cite{FGW2024}, the problem can be reformulated as an optimal control problem of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on suitable Hilbert spaces, which due to the roughness of the kernel, presents a generator of an analytic semigroup and unbounded control and diffusion operators.\n  This analysis leads us to study a general class of optimal control problems of abstract SDEs on Hilbert spaces with unbounded control and diffusion operators. This class includes optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels, but it is also motivated by other models. We analyze the regularity of the associated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck transition semigroup. We prove that the semigroup exhibits a new smoothing property in control directions through a general observation operator $Γ$, which we call $Γ$-smoothing. This allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, establish a verification theorem, and construct optimal feedback controls. We apply these results to optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. To the best of our knowledge these are the first results of this kind for this abstract class of infinite dimensional problems and for the optimal control of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels."}
