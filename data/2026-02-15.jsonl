We also develop a finite element scheme for the linear problem using continuous, piecewise linear functions, prove a convergence result in energy norm, and derive an error bound in $L^2(Ω)$. Finally, we propose a practical scheme based on a diagonalization technique and derive an error bound in $L^2(Ω)$ using a regularization argument."}

Our target application is the computation of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output transfer functions arising from large-scale discretizations of problems with continuous spectral measures, such as linear time-invariant PDEs on unbounded domains. Traditional Krylov methods, such as Lanczos or conjugate gradients, focus on resolving individual eigenvalues of a dense discretization, while ignoring the underlying continuous spectral measure that these points approximate. We argue that it is more efficient to model the inherent branch cut of the original operator than to exhaustively resolve the artificial point spectrum induced by discretization. We place this problem in a framework, known in the physics literature as the square-root terminator. To overcome its limitations, we formulate a quadratic terminator using Kreĭn--Nudelman semi-infinite strings, with parameters chosen adaptively to maximize relative energy outflow.\n  This approach results in a low-rank modification to the (block) Lanczos matrix, dependent on $\\sqrt{s}$, with an additional $O(n)$ cost. We demonstrate significant error reductions for large-scale self-adjoint PDE discretizations in unbounded domains, including two- and three-dimensional Maxwell's equations in diffusive regimes. The method proves particularly advantageous in computing state-space solutions for wave propagation, specifically for 2D wave and 3D Maxwell's operators. Implicitly replacing the conventional Lanczos spectral decomposition with a representation in terms of the continuous Kreĭn--Nudelman spectrum, we obtain a qualitative improvement in finite-difference approximations, effectively transforming standing-wave artifacts into outgoing propagating waves."}

In this work, we discretize the MFG system using finite difference method and analyze the resulting fully discrete GCG scheme. Under suitable structural assumptions on the Hamiltonian and coupling terms, we establish discrete maximum principles and derive explicit error estimates that quantify both discretization errors and iteration errors within a unified framework.

In this work, we present VEQ-R, a computationally efficient spectral solver designed to calculate fixed-boundary equilibria with arbitrary toroidal flow. In contrast to computationally intensive grid-based codes, our model employs a 12-parameter shifted Chebyshev spectral expansion to explicitly resolve radial variations in high-order shaping profiles--such as dynamic elongation and triangularity. This capability allows the solver to accurately capture differential flux surface distortions (non-rigid effects) even in challenging sonic regimes ($M \\sim 1.0$). By synergizing this compact variational formulation with a novel ``Matrix-Kernel'' acceleration technique, we transform the problem into pre-computed algebraic matrix operations. This approach achieves convergence in approximately 5 ms, maintaining exceptional geometric fidelity compared to high-resolution benchmarks while balancing speed and accuracy. Our analysis reveals that rotation-induced flux compression leads to a monotonic decrease in the core safety factor $q_0$, pushing it dangerously close to unity--a structural deformation mechanism effectively captured by this approximate yet robust solver."}

Two solvers are implemented: an analog Monte Carlo (AMC) engine and a semi-implicit Milstein SDE solver. Transient benchmarks demonstrate perfect agreement of AMC/SDE means with deterministic solutions, while revealing that the SDE approach underestimates DNP variances in selected regimes, potentially due to the neglect of DNP noise. We further recast reactivity loss due to precursor drift in this stochastic setting and show that its estimator is negatively biased. Overall, the developed framework provides a minimal yet representative model for CFR low-population kinetics.

We show that the bulk symbol hosts isolated band degeneracies acting as Berry--Chern monopoles, including a higher-order spin-1 degeneracy with topological charge $+2$ that generically splits into two spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ Weyl points under symmetry breaking. To characterize topology in this noncompact setting, we introduce a strip-gap Chern number associated with finite real-frequency strips of the bulk spectrum, extending band Chern topology to continuum systems. This invariant governs the spectral flow of interface modes induced by spatial variations of the magnetic field and establishes a bulk--interface correspondence at the level of phase-space symbols. By solving the interface eigenvalue problem, we demonstrate that the net spectral flow across the strip gap is determined by the enclosed monopole charge. We further show that this correspondence persists under collisional damping, provided that a finite strip gap remains and no exceptional points enter it.

Flow over a spanwise extruded NACA0012 airfoil at 0-degree angle of attack and freestream chord-based Reynolds numbers of 3 million is simulated using an unstructured-grid finite-volume solver. An equilibrium wall function with the first off-wall grid point as the exchange location is used. Two scenarios are simulated wherein either the entire airfoil surface, or only a portion of it, is assumed turbulent based on linear stability calculations. For the latter scenario, the regular no-slip wall boundary condition is imposed in laminar regions. Using the same grid that was employed in the fully turbulent case, WMLES captured the skin friction in the turbulent region close to the RANS results. However, the skin friction is not well captured in the laminar region, due to far few grid points inside the boundary layer. When the near-wall grid was refined in the wall normal direction, the laminar region was captured accurately, but the turbulent region was not resolved well because the first off-wall point moved below the buffer-layer. To reconcile differing resolution requirements in the laminar and turbulent regions, a grid was generated based on the varying boundary layer thickness estimated from a precursor RANS simulation with a specified transition location. This grid produced improved results in the laminar region but resulted in a delayed transition location. Unsteady disturbances with the most amplified frequencies were introduced upstream of the neutral point. The transition process in the laminar region and the skin friction in the turbulent region were then captured satisfactorily."}

Building on the recently developed theory on nonlinear damping by KHI-induced turbulence in impulsively driven transverse loop oscillations, we investigate its observational signatures using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and forward-modelled EUV images. The simulated oscillations exhibit time-varying frequency shifts and damping rates, which are broadly consistent with nonlinear turbulence-damping theory. Additionally, they exhibit excitation of higher-order modes, slightly increased periods relative to the linear kink period, and reduced displacement amplitudes. These features are generally preserved in synthetic observations, though resolving higher-order modes requires higher spatial resolution than currently available. For loops embedded in a hotter background, hotter channels (e.g., 193 Angstroms) are more sensitive to boundary dynamics, thus their oscillations decay faster with smaller displacements and larger phase shifts than those in cooler channels (e.g., 171 Angstroms). Comparisons of simulated and synthetic oscillations show close agreement at the early stage. At later times, synthetic oscillations exhibit smaller displacements and larger phase shifts, due to turbulence-induced asymmetry in the loop cross-section. Bayesian fitting shows that the initial oscillation amplitude and kink period are robustly constrained, whereas parameters controlling the damping profile are degenerate, indicating that additional observables would aid reliable seismological inference. These results provide a quantitative basis for identifying nonlinear damping and detecting KHI-driven turbulence in transverse loop oscillations."}

We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy.

Extending this approach to general $C^1$ radial potentials is challenging due to the lack of explicit basis functions analogous to Bessel functions. To overcome this difficulty, we consider the equation $-Δu + V u = λu$ on a ball containing $Ω$, without imposing boundary conditions, for a collection of values $λ$ forming a fine discretisation of the interval in which eigenvalues are sought. By rewriting the problem in polar coordinates and applying a Fourier expansion with respect to the angular variable, we obtain a decoupled system of ordinary differential equations.

In many-query regimes such as design optimization, control and inverse problems, surrogate modeling must generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations. In this work, we propose Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer (ArGEnT), a geometry-aware attention-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains. ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features. By integrating ArGEnT into DeepONet as the trunk network, we develop a surrogate modeling framework capable of learning operator mappings that depend on both geometric and non-geometric inputs without the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as a branch network input. Evaluation on benchmark problems spanning fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electrochemical systems, we demonstrate significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared with the standard DeepONet and other existing geometry-aware saurrogates. In particular, the cross-attention transformer variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions. By combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities, ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems."}

Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features.

Here we only require $L^1$-type decay at infinity and allow for $L^q$-type singularities. We reach this improvement by providing a refinement of the Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge resolvent estimate, which replaces the classical Agmon-Hörmander estimates used previously. Crucially, the time-independent setting allows us to avoid the use of complex geometrical optics solutions and thereby dispense with strong decay assumptions at infinity."}

This equation is known to be the two dimensional counterpart to the classical energy-critical Schrödinger equations \\cite{CollianderIbrahimMajdoubMasmoudi2009}. The authors of \\cite{CollianderIbrahimMajdoubMasmoudi2009} also identified a trichotomy around the criticality of the equation based on the size of the total energy. In particular, for supercritical regimes (large energy), the equation is known to exhibit instabilities : the (uniform) continuity of the flow fails to hold. Large data distributional non unique probabilistic solutions have been obtained in \\cite{CasterasMonsaingeon2024}. The setting of \\cite{CasterasMonsaingeon2024} does not handle the uniqueness issue for the $H^1$-data and therefore could not define a flow for this regularity. Our main focus here is to build a single probabilistic framework that provides both existence, uniqueness, and continuity with respect to the initial data in $H^1$. Our uniqueness and continuity are based on the so-called Yudowich argument \\cite{Judovic1963}, and the probabilistic estimates are derived through the IID limit procedure \\cite{Sy2019}. Beyond the difficulties related to the borderline nature of the context, the major challenge resides in the need to satisfy two features that tend to play against each other : obtaining both continuity property of the flow and large data in the support of the reference measure. This made the design of the dissipation operator inherent in the method, as well as the analysis of the resulting quantities, particularly difficult. Regarding the supercritical regime, we show that a modified energy, with regularity similar to the original total energy, admits values as high as desired, suggesting that the constructed set of data contains supercritical ones."}

We first introduce a novel graph-based null decomposition approach to analyzing the strong Feller property of the Markov semigroup generated by SPDEs on tree graphs. By examining the positions of zero entries in eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian operator, we establish a sharp upper bound on the number of noise-free edges that ensures both the strong Feller property and irreducibility. Interestingly, we find that the addition of noise to any single edge is sufficient for chain graphs, whereas for star graphs, at most one edge can remain noise-free without compromising the system's properties. Furthermore, under a dissipative condition, we prove the existence and exponential ergodicity of a unique invariant measure."}

The evolution of the system body-fluid is studied in a frame attached to the body. The choice of this special frame becomes critical from an analytical point of view due to the presence of the term $ω\\times x\\cdot\\nabla u$ in the balance of momentum equation for the fluid. As a consequence, we are forced to look for a technique that is different from the ones usually employed both for the existence and for the partial regularity of a weak solution to the Navier-Stokes problem. Hence, we prove the existence of a weak solution in an original way and give a new proof of the celebrated Théorème de Structure due to Leray. However, the regularity obtained for our weak solution is only for large times, hence our result is weaker compared to the one obtained by Leray."}

We establish exponential local convergence in $χ^2$-divergence with sharp rates, under two main assumptions: (i) the stationary measures satisfy a Poincaré inequality, and (ii) the velocity field satisfies a monotonicity condition, which reduces to linear convexity of the objective in the gradient flow case. We do not assume any form of displacement convexity or displacement monotonicity.\n  In the gradient flow case, global exponential convergence is already known under our linear convexity assumption, with an asymptotic rate governed by the log-Sobolev constant of the stationary measure. Our contribution in this setting is to identify the sharp rate near equilibrium governed instead by the Poincaré constant. This rate coincides with the one suggested by Otto calculus (i.e. by a tight positivity estimate of the Wasserstein Hessian), and refines some results of Tamura (1984), extending them beyond quadratic objectives.\n  More importantly, our proof technique extends to certain non-gradient systems, such as linearly monotone two-player and multi-player games. In this case, we obtain explicit local exponential convergence rates in $χ^2$-divergence, thereby partially answering the open question raised by the authors at COLT 2024. While that question concerns global convergence (which remains open), even local convergence results were previously unavailable.\n  At the heart of our analysis is the design of a Lyapunov functional that mixes the $χ^2$-divergence with weighted negative Sobolev norms of the density relative to equilibrium."}

Extending this approach to general $C^1$ radial potentials is challenging due to the lack of explicit basis functions analogous to Bessel functions. To overcome this difficulty, we consider the equation $-Δu + V u = λu$ on a ball containing $Ω$, without imposing boundary conditions, for a collection of values $λ$ forming a fine discretisation of the interval in which eigenvalues are sought. By rewriting the problem in polar coordinates and applying a Fourier expansion with respect to the angular variable, we obtain a decoupled system of ordinary differential equations. These equations are solved numerically using a one-dimensional Finite Element Method, yielding a family of basis functions that are solutions of the equation $-Δu + V u = λu$ on the ball and are independent of the domain $Ω$.\n  Dirichlet eigenvalues of $-Δ+ V$ are then approximated by minimising the boundary values on $\\partial Ω$ among linear combinations of the basis functions and identifying those values of $λ$ for which the computed minimum is sufficiently small.

By focusing the analysis on bond-based models, we prove mathematically that the critical stretch criterion and the critical energy density criterion are not equivalent in general and result in different bond-breaking and fracture phenomena.
