Motivated by the effective low-rank structure that emerges after tensorization of discretized transport and diffusion dynamics, we encode PDE states as matrix product states (MPS) and represent the evolution operator as a structured low-rank matrix product operator (MPO) in tensor-train form (e.g., arising from finite-difference discretizations assembled in MPO form). The MPO is applied directly in MPS form, and rank growth is controlled via canonicalization and SVD-based truncation after each step. We provide theoretical context through standard matrix product properties, including exact MPS representability bounds, local optimality of SVD truncation, and a Lipschitz-type multi-step error propagation estimate. Experiments on one- and two-dimensional linear advection-diffusion and nonlinear viscous Burgers equations demonstrate accurate short-horizon prediction, favorable scaling in smooth diffusive regimes, and error growth in nonlinear multi-step predictions."}

However, they suffer from an inherent limitation: secular phase-shift errors. While the qualitative ''shape'' of invariant tori is preserved, the numerical solution gradually drifts along the torus, leading to a phase-lag accumulation that degrades long-term positional accuracy. Inspired by the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain (CWB) scheme, originally developed as an analytical tool for infinite-dimensional systems, we introduce a numerical operator that incorporates frequency updates into a dimension-enlarged Newton iteration to compute quasi-periodic solutions. Unlike conventional time-stepping integrators, our alternating numerical procedure eliminates phase-lag accumulation by directly solving for instantaneous positions and phase angles. Theoretically, provided sufficient computational resources, the phase error can be reduced arbitrarily, remaining independent of the total integration time. Our algorithm translates the Nash-Moser iteration into a practical numerical framework, marking a significant departure from traditional Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory. While KAM provides rigorous existence proofs, its requirement for global Diophantine conditions and the total exclusion of resonant sets render it numerically inaccessible. By employing a ''step-by-step'' exclusion process and incrementally enlarging the dimension, our algorithm resolves irrationality conditions locally. This approach demonstrates that the ''numerical irrationality problem'' is not an intrinsic barrier to computation, offering a constructive, executable alternative to the non-executable nature of global KAM-based methods."}

To address this limitation, rolling friction is commonly introduced as an approximation to account for particle shape effects by applying a resistive torque to spherical particles. Among existing rolling friction formulations, the spring-dashpot (S-D) type model is widely recognized for its numerical stability and realistic representation of rolling resistance. However, conventional S-D models require multiple empirical parameters that must be calibrated in an interdependent manner, leading to increased experimental effort, parameter ambiguity, and uncertainty in practical applications. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a new S-D type rolling friction model that reduces the parameter set to a single physically meaningful quantity: the critical rolling angle. Derived from theoretical considerations, this parameter characterizes the transition from static to rolling motion at particle contacts. The use of a single parameter simplifies implementation and eliminates the need for extensive calibration. Stability analysis demonstrates that the proposed model allows particles to reach a physically consistent equilibrium state without spurious rotational oscillations. For large-scale applications, the model is further integrated into a coarse-grained DEM framework. Validation using DEM-CFD simulations of an incinerator system confirms that the proposed approach successfully reproduces the macroscopic behavior of the original particle system. Overall, this study enhances the applicability of DEM for industrial-scale simulations involving non-spherical particles."}

Two architectures, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), were trained for fixed source problems to learn the mapping from anisotropic neutron sources, Q(x,μ), to the corresponding angular fluxes, ψ(x,μ), in a one-dimensional slab geometry. Three distinct models were trained for each neural operator, corresponding to different scattering ratios (c = 0.1, 0.5, & 1.0), providing insight into their performance across distinct transport regimes (absorption-dominated, moderate, and scattering-dominated). The models were subsequently evaluated on a wide range of previously unseen source configurations, demonstrating that FNO generally achieves higher predictive accuracy, while DeepONet offers greater computational efficiency. Both models offered significant speedups that become increasingly pronounced as the scattering ratio increases, requiring <0.3% of the runtime of a conventional S_N solver. The surrogate models were further incorporated into the S_N k-eigenvalue solver, replacing the computationally intensive transport sweep loop with a single forward pass. Across varying fission cross sections and spatial-angular grids, both neural operator solvers reproduced reference eigenvalues with deviations up to 135 pcm for DeepONet and 112 pcm for FNO, while reducing runtime to <0.1% of that of the S_N solver on relatively fine grids. These results demonstrate the strong potential of neural operator frameworks as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, paving the way for real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations, such as in design optimization."}

To understand how these cognitive time scales shape population-level patterns, we propose and analyze a nonlocal population model with a cognitive map. The population density moves by a Fokker--Planck type diffusion driven by a cognitive map that stores a habitat quality information nonlocally. The map is updated through local presence with learning and forgetting rates, and we consider both truncated and normalized perception kernels.\n  We first study the movement-only system without growth. We show that finite perceptual range generates spatial heterogeneity in the cognitive map even in nearly homogeneous habitats, and we prove a lingering phenomenon on unimodal landscapes: for the fixed high learning rate, the peak density near the best location is maximized at an intermediate forgetting rate.\n  We then couple cognitive diffusion to logistic growth. We establish local well-posedness and persistence by proving instability of the extinction equilibrium and the existence of a positive steady state, with uniqueness under an explicit condition on the motility function. Numerical simulations show that lingering persists under logistic growth and reveal a trade-off between the lingering and total population size, since near the strongest-lingering regime the total mass can fall below the total resource, in contrast to classical random diffusive--logistic models."}

As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems."}

By varying the plasma length and measuring the radius of the transverse distribution of the bunch, we find that the saturation length of SM decreases with plasma density and initial field amplitude, e.g., when seeding. The saturation length is a fundamental parameter of the instability, and these results are key for understanding SM and designing plasma wakefield accelerators driven by long bunches, such as AWAKE, or by long laser pulses for radiation production."}

For incompressible Hall MHD we develop a reduced model for wave-wave interactions concentrating on those processes that will lead to phase coherent modifications to the linear dispersion of a given wave. We show that these special interactions provide an amplitude-dependent contribution to the linear dispersion relation, which yields nonlinear frequency shifts. The resonance-driven frequency shifts are dominant and add damping or growth to the linear dispersion. The damping/growth rates represent the nonlinear time scales for energy redistribution and can be used in conjunction with a conjecture like the \"critical balance\" to estimate the energy spectral content."}

The type of intermittency depends on how energy is pumped into the system, and how it is dissipated. While intermittency is usually driven by stochastic noise or external forcing, energy can also be sourced from field-mediated interactions between particles, which are often nonreciprocal and effectively violate Newton's 3rd law. Here we demonstrate how nonreciprocal interactions produce intermittency in clusters of charged micron-sized particles confined in a plasma sheath. Through three-dimensional particle tracking, we observe that vertical oscillations, induced by fluctuations of the plasma environment, can be parametrically coupled to the horizontal modes. Experiments and simulations show that nonreciprocal interactions strongly amplify this parametric coupling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives explosive growth of both the horizontal and vertical modes. This mechanism triggers abrupt melting transitions from an ordered cluster to an ergodic gas-like state, and leads to intermittent switching between states over long time scales. Overall, our work identifies nonreciprocal interactions as a key mechanism through which strongly coupled finite systems transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states."}

First version", "summary": "Photochromic materials enable dynamic optical modulation through reversible transitions between distinct absorption states, with broad potential for smart windows, adaptive optics, and reconfigurable photonic devices. Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range. Our methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials."}

It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons."}

The fluid is subject to a uniform gravitational field and capillary forces acting along the free boundary. The interface between the fluid and the surrounding air is a free surface whose motion is driven by gravity, surface tension, and the fluid velocity field. The triple-phase intersections where the fluid, the air above the vessel, and the solid vessel wall meet are referred to as contact points, and the angles formed there are called contact angles. The model under consideration incorporates boundary conditions that allow for full motion of the contact points and dynamic contact angles. Under these conditions, \\cite{Yang} established the existence of equilibrium configurations for the model. These equilibria consist of a quiescent fluid occupying a domain whose upper boundary can be represented as the graph of a function in polar coordinates, minimizing a gravity-capillary energy functional subject to a fixed mass constraint. The equilibrium contact angles may take any value in $(0,π)$ depending on the choice of capillary parameters. In the present work, we develop a framework of a priori estimates for this model. We prove that, for initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium, the system admits global solutions that converge exponentially fast to a (horizontally) shifted equilibrium state."}

The first prolate spheroidal wavefunction (PSWF) has optimal concentration in real and Fourier space simultaneously, and is used when defining both a mollifier and a window function. We provide a complete description of the method and derive rigorous error estimates. In addition, we obtain closed-form approximations of the Fourier truncation and aliasing errors, yielding explicit parameter choices for the achieved error to closely match the prescribed tolerance.

We present a combined dynamic contact angle (DCA) model that merges the geometric accuracy of the generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law with the kinematic consistency of a Hoffman function-based approach, improving predictions of droplet spreading and receding. We simulate water-glycerol droplet impact on sapphire glass at Weber numbers 20 -- 250 and assess both contact angle formulations. Simulated radial velocity fields are processed in Python using SciPy and compared with Particle Image Velocimetry measurements in the longitudinal section of the spreading droplet. The Hoffman function-based model captures the main droplet kinematic trends and provides more consistent receding dynamics. The generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law matches the maximum spreading diameter within 7%. However, during receding, it shows a median absolute error in radial velocity up to three times higher than that of the Hoffman function-based solution. Average radial velocity and spreading velocity can differ from experimental trends even when maximum spreading is reproduced. These findings support validation combining geometric and kinematic metrics and motivate the combined model for predicting spreading and receding. Using the maximum spreading factor $β_{max}$ as the ratio of the maximum spreading diameter over the initial droplet diameter and the characteristic capillary number $Ca_{char}$ defined from the mean internal horizontal velocity at 300 micrometer above the substrate, we introduce a $(β_{max},\\,Ca_{char})$ diagram to relate spreading characteristics to internal flow dynamics.

In this work, we develop a fluctuating lattice Boltzmann formulation based on an orthogonal central-moments-based representation. Stochastic forcing is introduced directly in the space of central moments (CMs) and consistently paired with mode-dependent relaxation, yielding a discrete kinetic model that satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem exactly at the lattice level. Owing to the orthogonality of the basis, the equilibrium covariance matrix of the central moments is diagonal, and each non-conserved mode can be interpreted as an independent discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with variance fixed by equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting formulation guarantees exact equipartition of kinetic energy at equilibrium, preserves Galilean invariance, and retains the enhanced numerical stability characteristic of CMs-based collision operators. Explicit fluctuating schemes are constructed for the D2Q9 and D3Q27 lattices. The extension to reduced-velocity discretisation is discussed too. A comprehensive set of numerical tests verifies correct thermalisation, isotropy of equilibrium statistics, and the expected scaling of velocity fluctuations with thermal energy, density, and relaxation time. In contrast to fluctuating BGK formulations, the present method remains stable and well posed in the over-relaxation regime, including in the immediate vicinity of the stability limit.

This study focuses on tension twins during uniaxial compression of Mg-Y alloys, with three key aspects: the orientation specificity of twin grains, the relative evolution of CRSS with increasing Y content, and the local stress and strain evolution at twin sites. Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling were performed. In Mg-7wt.%Y, TT2-{112-1} tension twins were observed in addition to the common TT1-{101-2} twins. Increasing Y suppressed TT1 formation while promoting TT2 activity. A previously unreported group of crystallographic orientations with a higher global Schmid factor for <c+a> slip was identified, which exhibited TT1 twinning with increasing compression strain. To elucidate Y effects on twin activity and local mechanical fields, both TT1 and TT2 tension twin modes were incorporated into PRISMS-Plasticity, an open-source, finite element-based crystal plasticity solver. Four binary Mg-Y alloys were modeled under compression, and statistical analysis was conducted to correlate initial orientations, stress-strain distributions, and twin activities as functions of Y concentration. The plasticity analysis revealed that increasing Y decreases the CRSS ratio of prismatic and pyramidal slip relative to TT1 twinning, while the slip-to-twin CRSS ratio for TT2 increases, thereby serving as a potential indicator of differential twin activity with Y addition in Mg alloys. Additionally, despite their small volume fraction, TT2 twin sites were predicted higher local strain accumulation locally, relative to the representative volume element and TT1 twins, suggesting their potential influence on localized phenomena such as recrystallization or twin nucleation. These findings provide insight into local mechanical behavior in Mg alloys and support alloy design for advanced engineering applications."}

Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges."}

Precisely, by extending and refining an approach initially introduced by J.B. McLeod, we demonstrate the continuous invertibility of the linearized operator at a generic Couette-Poiseuille solution that does not exhibit flow reversal. We then deduce local uniqueness of these solutions as well as their nonlinear structural stability under small external forces. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness of certain class of Couette-Poiseuille solutions ``in the large,\" within the set of solutions possessing natural symmetry.

Probabilistic approaches to global wellposedness problems usually provide ensemble bounds on the solutions. These bounds are the main tools to ensure convergence procedures yielding the existence and uniqueness of global solutions. A question of interest consists in transforming such ensemble bounds into individual controls on the flow ; this, among other uses, gives valuable information on the long-time behavior of the solutions. Toward such question of bounds transformation, Bourgain initiated a successful procedure that exploited the local wellposedness of the PDE, with an estimate of the time of size-doubling. In this note, we construct an estimation procedure which relies on a different local requirement. It turns out that this substitute is flexible enough to be possible to fulfill with the help of the ensemble bound itself. For applications of the procedure, we are able to provide new pathwise controls on solutions to NLS equations."}

The model admits self-similar solutions, and our goal is to analyze their stability. We reformulate the problem in mass-Lagrangian coordinates and exploit the underlying gradient-flow structure of the equation with respect to a weighted $L^2$ inner product, where the weight is given by the self-similar source-type profile. This framework allows us to establish a coercivity result for the Hessian (the linearization around the self-similar solution) in a suitably weighted inner product. As a consequence, we prove the convergence of perturbations toward the self-similar profile at an algebraic rate of order $t^{-\\frac 1 5}$, in arbitrary scales of weighted Sobolev norms. The analysis relies on maximal-regularity estimates for the linearized evolution, combined with appropriate estimates for the nonlinear terms.\n  Notably, beyond perturbative regimes and in contrast to previous results for the thin-film equation (convergence to the Smyth-Hill profile) or the porous-medium equation (convergence to the Barenblatt-Pattle solution), our analysis does not rely on an explicit (algebraic) representation of the self-similar profile. Instead, it is based solely on a systematic use of the ordinary differential equation satisfied by the self-similar solution, together with a careful analysis of its boundary asymptotics. As a result, we expect that the approach developed here can serve as a flexible toolbox for the study of more general classes of equations and for the stability analysis of special solutions in future work."}

Secondly, in contrast to the purely Dirichlet case, a key challenge is to establish the non-vanishing of the tangential derivative of $u$ along the Neumann boundary. To address this, we employ local analysis techniques of angular derivatives, as introduced by Hartman and Wintner [Amer. J. Math., 1953]. Thirdly, we identify the signs of directional derivatives of $u$ along sections of the moving line. Using a planar sub-spherical sector as an example, we illustrate how these new innovative techniques and the moving plane method can be combined to derive symmetry and monotonicity results, particularly when the amplitude is less than or equal to $2π/3$."}

Working initially at a fixed cosmological constant $Λ>0$ and uniformly for $(M,a)$ in a compact slow-rotation set, using the meromorphic/Fredholm framework for quasinormal modes and a semiclassical equatorial labeling proved in a companion paper, we establish a quantitative two-mode dominance theorem in an equatorial high-frequency package: after exact azimuthal reduction, microlocal equatorial localization, and analytic pole selection by entire localization weights constructed from equatorial pseudopoles, the $k=\\pm\\ell$ sector signals are each governed by a single quasinormal exponential, up to an explicitly controlled tail and an $\\mathcal O(\\ell^{-\\infty})$ contribution from all other poles. We then develop a fully deterministic frequency-extraction stability estimate based on time-shift invariance, and combine it with the two-mode dominance result and the companion paper's inverse stability theorem to obtain an explicit parameter bias bound for ringdown-based recovery of $(M,a)$. Finally, using the companion paper's three-parameter inverse theorem and a damping observable based on the scaled imaginary part of one equatorial mode, we propagate the same deterministic error chain to a local bias bound for recovery of $(M,a,Λ)$ on compact parameter sets with $|a|$ bounded away from $0$. As a further consequence, we obtain a localized pseudospectral stability statement for the equatorial resolvent package, quantifying how large microlocalized resolvent norms enforce proximity to the labeled equatorial poles. The resulting estimates clarify the conditioning mechanisms (start time, window length, shift step, and detector nondegeneracy) and provide a rigorous PDE-to-data interface for high-frequency black-hole spectroscopy."}
