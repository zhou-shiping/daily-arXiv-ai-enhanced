They compute dimensions of spaces of generalized twisted Pollicott-Ruelle resonant states at zero for any representation in U_g. This spectral analysis approach allows them to determine the vanishing order and values of the twisted Ruelle zeta function at s=0.", "result": "For surfaces with Anosov geodesic flow: 1) For representations in U_g that factor through the surface fundamental group, the twisted Ruelle zeta function vanishes at s=0 to order dim(\u03c1)(2G-2). 2) For other representations in U_g, the zeta function doesn't vanish and \u03b6_{g,\u03c1}(0) equals the Reidemeister-Turaev torsion. The complement of U_g has complex codimension at least one, making U_g a generic set.", "conclusion": "The work successfully extends Fried's conjecture to a generic set of acyclic (not necessarily unitary) representations on surfaces with Anosov geodesic flow. The results connect spectral properties (Pollicott-Ruelle resonances) with topological invariants (Reidemeister-Turaev torsion), providing a bridge between dynamical systems and topology for a broad class of representations."}}
