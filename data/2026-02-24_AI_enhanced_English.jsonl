One way to take advantage of the spatial and temporal traits believed to characterize the solution is to encode them into the entries of a dictionary, and to seek the solution as a sparse linear combination of the dictionary atoms. To promote a vector of coefficients with mostly vanishing entries, we consider a stochastic extension of the dictionary coding problem model with a random hierarchical sparsity promoting prior.

Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) offers an attractive data-driven reduction framework, but its operators are trained for a single set of reservoir properties. When permeability or well location changes, conventional practice is to regenerate snapshots and retrain the surrogate, erasing most of the speed advantage. This work presents a lightweight alternative that updates an existing DMD or DMD-with-control model without incorporating new simulation data or retraining. Two complementary update strategies are introduced. For cases where permeability changes uniformly across the domain, the proposed updates adjust the models internal dynamics and control response to match the new flow timescale.

The smallest magnetic gradient scale length on the LCFS - denoted L_gradB - has been shown to be a good proxy for minimum coil-surface distance in optimizations of a current potential on a winding surface, such as through the REGCOIL method. However, it has not been shown the same is true for filament coils, or that the magnetic gradient scale length is an effective objective function in optimization. In this paper, we explore examples in which min(L_gradB) is correlated with the minimum coil-surface distance for filament coils. First, we analyze a subset of the single-stage-optimized equilibria from the QUASR dataset [Giuliani et al. JPP (2024)]. We find that the majority of configurations have min(L_gradB) located nearby the point of closest coil-surface distance. Second, we optimize quasihelically symmetric equilibria to have improved min(L_gradB), and optimize coils via a continuation method. We then traced alpha particles to test confinement. Finally, we compare min(L_gradB) to the minimum coil-surface distance with filament coils optimized for a set of finite beta equilibria with random boundary shapes. For all datasets, we find that min(L_gradB) is correlated with both the minimum coil-surface and coil-coil distances if sufficient coil length is allowed. Even when there is a trade-off with proxies for confinement, optimizing for improved min(L_gradB) can result in better confinement in the presence of coils, up to a point. This is because - when holding coil-coil distance constant - equilibria with lower min(L_gradB) have a larger normal field error dominated by coil ripple causing particle loss. Both can be reduced by increasing coil-surface distance for equilibria with a high min(L_gradB).", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper shows that the minimum magnetic gradient scale length (min(L_gradB)) correlates with coil-surface and coil-coil distances in stellarator optimization, and improving min(L_gradB) can enhance particle confinement up to a point.", "motivation": "To determine if min(L_gradB) is an effective proxy for coil-surface distance in filament coil optimizations and whether it serves as a useful objective function for improving stellarator engineering feasibility and particle confinement.", "method": "1) Analyzed QUASR dataset equilibria for correlation between min(L_gradB) and coil-surface distance; 2) Optimized quasihelically symmetric equilibria for improved min(L_gradB) and designed coils via continuation method; 3) Compared min(L_gradB) to coil distances for random boundary shapes with finite beta equilibria; 4) Conducted alpha particle tracing for confinement testing.", "result": "min(L_gradB) correlates with both minimum coil-surface and coil-coil distances when sufficient coil length is allowed.

To understand this process, we develop a minimal model of a growing thin active droplet driven by a self-generated chemical gradient. In broad agreement with the experiments, dynamic simulations reveal that chemotacting droplets exhibit proliferation-driven morphological transitions. To fully characterise these transitions, we perform a multiple scales analysis to show that the droplet dynamics follow a sequence of travelling wave solutions defined by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem parametrised by the slowly increasing droplet volume. Our analysis reveals that morphological transitions can occur continuously or through a discontinuous bifurcation. Further asymptotic analysis of the travelling wave problem reveals that these morphological transitions arise from exponentially small (\"beyond-all-orders\") asymptotic terms that originate from the rear and front contact lines.
