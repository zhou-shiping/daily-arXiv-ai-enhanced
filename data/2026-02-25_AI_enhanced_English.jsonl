The second is based on a symmetric representation and Newton-type iterations. We propose numerical implementations for both methodologies that avoid working with dense matrices and maintain low memory consumption. Furthermore, we study both types of embeddings numerically using real data from publicly available datasets.

This question is highly complex, due to a complicated set of polynomial inequalities that need to be simultaneously satisfied. This paper introduces the JuMP + Groebner basis + discriminant polynomial approach as well as the use of interval arithmetic computations. Thus, we are introducing a marriage of numerical and exact mathematical computations.\n  In 1988, Day and Peterson performed numerical optimization on $n=5$ with NPSOL and obtained a largest seen value of $4.1325...$. This same best value was reproduced by Gould with LANCELOT in 1991. We ran extensive comparable experiments with the modern software tool JuMP and also saw the same value $4.1325...$. While the combinatorial explosion of possibilities prevents us from knowing there may not be a larger maximum, we succeed in obtaining the exact mathematical value: the number $4.1325...$ is exactly the root of a 61st degree polynomial provided in this work, and is a maximum given the equality constraints seen by JuMP. In light of the numerics, we pose the conjecture that this lower bound is indeed the maximum. We also apply this technique to $n = 6$, $7$, and $8$.\n  Furthermore, in 1969, an upper bound of $4\\frac{17}{18}\\approx 4.94$ was produced for the maximum possible growth for $n = 5$.

The intrinsic decoupling of the confining magnetic field-generating REBCO magnets and the vacuum vessel offer unparalleled accessibility and maintainability, allowing for high plant duty factors and theoretically low electricity prices. In order to achieve rapid deployment of fusion power to the grid, the use of the Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel cycle is required due to its lower required plasma triple products. Historically, designs of levitated dipole fusion power plants have targeted advanced fuels as a DT device was seen to be infeasible due to the high fluxes of 14.1 MeV neutrons on the superconducting core magnet. This study presents high level designs for two feasible first-of-a-kind (FOAK) DT levitated dipole fusion power plants, the larger of which produces 667 MW of fusion power and is predicted to produce 208 MW of net electric power. Both designs consist of a heavily neutron-shielded, high-field REBCO core magnet capable of producing peak magnetic field strengths of 23 T while keeping peak mechanical strains below 0.4%. The neutron shielding is comprised of a layered structure of tungsten and boron carbide, which allows for 92% of the heat deposited in the neutron shield to be radiated out to the first wall while still providing sufficient neutron attenuation to give adequate REBCO conductor lifetimes. The core magnet REBCO coil is comprised of a small \"sacrificial\" section and a larger semi-permanent section. The sacrificial section, comprising ~20% of the coil, will have a neutron damage limited lifetime of ~1 year, after which the core magnet will be quickly removed from the vacuum vessel and replaced.
