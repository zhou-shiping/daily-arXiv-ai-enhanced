This work examines the early-lifetime electron heating of moderately coupled, strongly magnetized plasmas. This heating is dominated by disorder-induced heating and heating due to Rydberg atom formation. By using experimentally informed simulations, it is found that disorder-induced heating has a large influence in electron temperature well into the plasma lifetime.

Spectral analyses of the \"triad\" entropy transfer function introduced in this study reveal not only the nonlinear interactions among the zonal and non-zonal modes, but also their effects on the turbulent transport level. Different types of the entropy transfer processes between the ITG and ETG turbulence are found: The entropy transfer from non-zonal to zonal modes is substantial in the saturation phase of the ITG instability, while, once the strong zonal flow is generated, the entropy transfer to the zonal modes becomes quite weak in the steady turbulence state. Instead, the zonal flows mediate the entropy transfer from non-zonal modes with low radial-wavenumbers (with contribution to the heat flux) to the other non-zonal modes with higher radial-wavenumbers (but with less contribution to the heat flux) through the triad interaction. The successive entropy transfer processes to the higher radial-wavenumber modes are associated with transport regulation in the steady turbulence state. In contrast, in both the instability-saturation and steady phases of the ETG turbulence, the entropy transfer processes among low-wavenumber non-zonal modes are dominant rather than the transfer via zonal modes."}

In its original formulation, the committor is represented by a neural network that takes physical descriptors as input and is trained by minimizing a functional involving gradients with respect to atomic coordinates, which can be computationally demanding in some cases. Here, we propose a simplified learning criterion formulated entirely in the descriptor space, which bypasses the need for explicit and costly coordinate gradients and provides a relaxed upper bound to the original variational principle. Although this approach does not formally target the exact committor, we show that it retains robust sampling performance while significantly reducing computational costs, thus enabling the study of processes that would be practically unfeasible using the original formulation."}

The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations."}

It is shown that random fluctuations of polytropic processes produce a nonzero overall heating of a particle system, e.g., solar wind plasma flowing out through the heliosphere; while any nonturbulent heating can be thermodynamically described by typical nonfluctuating polytropic processes, turbulent heating can be thermodynamically described through fluctuating polytropic processes. First, we derive the expression of the overall process and find that polytropic fluctuations lead to heat entering the system even if the respective nonfluctuating process is adiabatic. The temperature of the solar wind plasma protons decreases with heliospheric distance less than the adiabatic cooling, again, similar to when heating enters the system; this subadiabatic cooling is proportional to the variance of the fluctuations. We derive the heliospheric radial profiles of the thermodynamic expressions of the polytropic index, temperature, and heating rates. Then, we show that the analytical profiles of heating of fluctuating polytropic processes and of turbulent heating are identical, suggesting that turbulence heats plasma particle populations by fluctuating their polytropic processes. We apply the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes to the energy transfer from pickup ions (PUIs) to solar wind plasma protons, and derive the analytical expressions of PUI turbulent and nonturbulent heating rates, which are well fitted to the respective observations. Finally, we apply the thermodynamic model to the radial profile of PUI energy transfer to the solar wind plasma protons, where we derive the portion of PUI turbulent vs. nonturbulent heating rates."}

They are nonlinear, localized plasma waves that maintain their shape and velocity over time and distance. While their occurrence in various space plasma environments has been extensively reported, their observation during geomagnetic storms, large-scale disturbances driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, remains limited. In this study, we present a comparative investigation of magnetosonic soliton signatures during geomagnetic storms associated with Solar Cycles 24 and 25. Using high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Cluster II mission, we systematically examine the plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation and their evolution during storm-time dynamics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework, incorporating several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, is developed to reliably detect and characterize magnetosonic solitons. The results demonstrate that solitary structures in both storms predominantly occur during the early storm intervals, prior to the main phase, suggesting that they may serve as potential precursor signatures of enhanced geomagnetic activity."}

The description with squeezed states holds for times $t$ that can go to infinity as $h\\to 0$, under the constraint $|t|\\leq |\\log h|/(6λ_0)$ where $λ_0$ is the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the classical dynamics. The breakdown of this approximation at time $|\\log h|/(6λ_0)$ is related to the bending of evolved wavepackets: once propagated states spread at a scale $h^{1/3}$, squeezed states no longer provide an appropriate description. To obtain a representation of propagated states valid up to times $|t|\\leq C|\\log h|$ with a larger $C$ (for instance, up to Ehrenfest's time $|\\log h|/(2λ_0)$ where spreading on macroscopic scales is allowed), we make additional assumptions on the flow $Φ_t$ associated to the classical dynamics, imposing constraints on directions of elongation. Namely, we work in a neighborhood of a normally hyperbolic $Φ_t$-invariant submanifold $K$, on which the dynamics is considered as slow in comparison with its transverse directions, along which $Φ_t$ is assumed to be hyperbolic. In this context, we describe the propagated state as a WKB state in transverse directions and a squeezed state along $K$. This description emphasizes the fact that propagated states should no longer be thought of as microlocalized on a point, but rather on an isotropic submanifold (corresponding to transverse unstable directions). Guillemin, Uribe, and Wang presented a similar class of wavefunctions microlocalized on an isotropic submanifold."}

We argue that current computer vision task formulations are inherently constrained by matrix-based thinking: standard architectures rely on matrix-valued weights and vectorvalued biases, requiring structural flattening that restricts the space of naturally expressible tasks. GE-MLPs lift this constraint by operating with tensor-valued parameters, enabling explicit control over which dimensions are preserved or contracted without information loss. Through rigorous mathematical derivations, we demonstrate that classification, segmentation, and detection are special cases of MTL, differing only in their dimensional configuration within a formally defined task space. We further prove that this task space is strictly larger than what matrix-based formulations can natively express, enabling principled task configurations such as spatiotemporal or cross modal predictions that require destructive flattening under conventional approaches. This work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing computer vision tasks through the lens of tensor algebra."}

Optical emission spectroscopy reveals that, unlike pulsed-DCMS where Ar$^{+}$ ions dominate, HiPIMS discharges are characterised by strong Y$^{+}$ emission, evidencing high yttrium ionisation and substantial self-sputter recycling. The critical working pressure (P$_c$) required to obtain transparent and photochromic films is higher for HiPIMS (Pc $\\approx$ 1.0 Pa) than for pulsed-DCMS (Pc $\\approx$ 0.5 Pa). Although films deposited near Pc exhibit similar solar transmittance (~72 %) and lattice parameters (5.38--5.39 Å), the pulsed-DCMS film shows a substantially higher relative photochromic contrast (34 %) and a lower optical band gap (2.70 eV) compared with the HiPIMS film (9 % contrast and 2.94 eV). This difference is partly attributed to a lower oxygen-to-hydrogen atomic ratio in the pulsed-DCMS film. Structurally, HiPIMS films are largely polycrystalline with random out-of-plane crystallographic orientation, whereas pulsed-DCMS films exhibit a pronounced <100> out-of-plane preferred orientation. These results demonstrate that, beyond composition, thin-film growth conditions and microstructure play a crucial role in governing the photochromic performance of YHO."}

We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time.

The major methodological contribution is the construction of ``paradifferential propagator\" corresponding to linear paradifferential hyperbolic systems along elliptic directions, making Lyapunov-Perron type arguments applicable. The method effectively balances the loss of regularity in quasilinear problems and can be generalized to a broader class of PDEs."}

We focus on the rigorous analysis of the low Mach number limit under well-prepared initial data. Our main result shows that, as the Mach number tends to zero, the partial densities converge to constant states while the velocity field converges to a divergence-free vector field, and we recover the incompressible non-homogenous fluid system. The volume fractions remain nontrivial and are transported by the limit flow. Our method is based on the introduction of suitable modulated quantities and a novel relative entropy functional adapted to the two-phase structure. The key novelty lies in an original comparison of L1 and L2 norms of the partial densities, exploiting the special structure of the bi-fluid system, together with a variant of Csiszar-Kullback- Pinsker inequality. It allows us to rigorously justify the convergence of weak solutions of the compressible system toward solutions of the corresponding incompressible limit system in the low Mach number regime."}

Under natural regularity assumptions (that are satisfied by solutions to the $σ_k$-Loewner-Nirenberg problem on annuli, for example), we first prove that the trace and normal derivatives of such a solution along the hypersurface satisfy a certain PDE. For $k=2$, we also show that the hypersurface is minimal with respect to the Lipschitz solution and address some questions related to the formal expansion of the solution near the hypersurface."}

In a perturbative sense, we prove Gaussian fluctuations about the Green's function of the Laplacian. The fluctuations are described by an explicit effective variance, up to a critical value of the coupling constant at which we expect a phase transition in the structure of the fluctuations. The proof is based on a combinatorial analysis of Feynman diagrams, and on a detailed study of the BPHZ renormalisation of the model. We characterise the limiting distribution in terms of primitive blow-ups, and prove that no Laplacian renormalisation is present. Our approach seems applicable to a broad class of equations."}
