### [1] [Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks for Approximating PDE Flow Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15906)
*Nahid Binandeh Dehaghani,Ban Q. Tran,Rafal Wisniewski,Susan Mengel,A. Pedro Aguiar*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Quantum-inspired tensor networks (QTNs) using matrix product states (MPS) and matrix product operators (MPO) are applied to approximate flow maps of hydrodynamic PDEs, with theoretical analysis and experimental validation on advection-diffusion and Burgers equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the effective low-rank structure that emerges after tensorization of discretized transport and diffusion dynamics in hydrodynamic PDEs. This low-rank structure makes tensor network methods suitable for approximating flow maps, potentially offering computational advantages for solving PDEs.

Method: The method encodes PDE states as matrix product states (MPS) and represents the evolution operator as a structured low-rank matrix product operator (MPO) in tensor-train form. The MPO is applied directly in MPS form, with rank growth controlled via canonicalization and SVD-based truncation after each time step. The approach uses finite-difference discretizations assembled in MPO form.

Result: Experiments on one- and two-dimensional linear advection-diffusion and nonlinear viscous Burgers equations demonstrate: (1) accurate short-horizon prediction, (2) favorable scaling in smooth diffusive regimes, and (3) error growth in nonlinear multi-step predictions.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired tensor networks provide a viable approach for approximating flow maps of hydrodynamic PDEs, with theoretical guarantees including exact MPS representability bounds, local optimality of SVD truncation, and error propagation estimates. The method shows promise for certain regimes but faces challenges with error accumulation in nonlinear multi-step predictions.

Abstract: We investigate quantum-inspired tensor networks (QTNs) for approximating flow maps of hydrodynamic partial differential equations (PDEs). Motivated by the effective low-rank structure that emerges after tensorization of discretized transport and diffusion dynamics, we encode PDE states as matrix product states (MPS) and represent the evolution operator as a structured low-rank matrix product operator (MPO) in tensor-train form (e.g., arising from finite-difference discretizations assembled in MPO form). The MPO is applied directly in MPS form, and rank growth is controlled via canonicalization and SVD-based truncation after each step. We provide theoretical context through standard matrix product properties, including exact MPS representability bounds, local optimality of SVD truncation, and a Lipschitz-type multi-step error propagation estimate. Experiments on one- and two-dimensional linear advection-diffusion and nonlinear viscous Burgers equations demonstrate accurate short-horizon prediction, favorable scaling in smooth diffusive regimes, and error growth in nonlinear multi-step predictions.

*Shashank K. Shukla,Gobinda Rakshit,Akshay S. Rane*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper analyzes superconvergence of eigenfunctions for compact integral operators using modified projection methods with piecewise even degree polynomials at collocation points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve convergence rates for eigenvalue and spectral subspace approximations of compact linear integral operators with Green's kernels beyond classical projection methods.

Method: Using orthogonal and interpolatory projections at 2r+1 collocation points (not necessarily Gauss points) onto approximating space of piecewise even degree polynomials, establishing superconvergence under iteration.

Result: Modified projection methods achieve faster convergence rates than classical methods, with superconvergence of eigenfunctions verified by numerical examples.

Conclusion: The proposed modified projection methods with piecewise even degree polynomials and collocation points significantly enhance convergence rates for eigenvalue problems of compact integral operators.

Abstract: We consider the eigenvalue problem $K x = λx$. Our analysis focuses on the convergence rates of eigenvalue and spectral subspace approximations for compact linear integral operator $K$ with Green's kernels. By employing orthogonal and interpolatory projections at $2r+1$ collocation points (which are not necessarily Gauss points) onto an approximating space of piecewise even degree polynomials, we establish the superconvergence of eigenfunctions under iteration. The modified projection methods achieve a faster convergence rates compared to classical projection methods. The enhancement in convergence rate is verified by numerical examples.

### [3] [Numerical Construction of Quasi-Periodic Solutions Beyond Symplectic Integrators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16275)
*Mingwei Fu,Bin Shi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new numerical method eliminates phase-lag accumulation in Hamiltonian simulations by using frequency updates and dimension-enlarged Newton iteration instead of traditional symplectic integrators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symplectic integrators, while preserving geometric structures, suffer from secular phase-shift errors that degrade long-term positional accuracy in nearly-integrable Hamiltonian systems. The phase-lag accumulation causes numerical solutions to drift along invariant tori over time.

Method: Inspired by the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain scheme, the method introduces a numerical operator that incorporates frequency updates into a dimension-enlarged Newton iteration. It uses an alternating numerical procedure that directly solves for instantaneous positions and phase angles rather than conventional time-stepping. The approach translates Nash-Moser iteration into a practical framework and employs a "step-by-step" exclusion process with incremental dimension enlargement to resolve irrationality conditions locally.

Result: The algorithm eliminates phase-lag accumulation, allowing phase error to be reduced arbitrarily (given sufficient computational resources) and remaining independent of total integration time. It demonstrates that the "numerical irrationality problem" is not an intrinsic barrier to computation.

Conclusion: This method offers a constructive, executable alternative to non-executable global KAM-based methods, marking a significant departure from traditional KAM theory by making quasi-periodic solutions numerically accessible through local resolution of irrationality conditions rather than requiring global Diophantine conditions.

Abstract: Symplectic integrators are the established standard for long-term simulations of nearly-integrable Hamiltonian systems due to their preservation of geometric structures. However, they suffer from an inherent limitation: secular phase-shift errors. While the qualitative ''shape'' of invariant tori is preserved, the numerical solution gradually drifts along the torus, leading to a phase-lag accumulation that degrades long-term positional accuracy. Inspired by the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain (CWB) scheme, originally developed as an analytical tool for infinite-dimensional systems, we introduce a numerical operator that incorporates frequency updates into a dimension-enlarged Newton iteration to compute quasi-periodic solutions. Unlike conventional time-stepping integrators, our alternating numerical procedure eliminates phase-lag accumulation by directly solving for instantaneous positions and phase angles. Theoretically, provided sufficient computational resources, the phase error can be reduced arbitrarily, remaining independent of the total integration time. Our algorithm translates the Nash-Moser iteration into a practical numerical framework, marking a significant departure from traditional Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory. While KAM provides rigorous existence proofs, its requirement for global Diophantine conditions and the total exclusion of resonant sets render it numerically inaccessible. By employing a ''step-by-step'' exclusion process and incrementally enlarging the dimension, our algorithm resolves irrationality conditions locally. This approach demonstrates that the ''numerical irrationality problem'' is not an intrinsic barrier to computation, offering a constructive, executable alternative to the non-executable nature of global KAM-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model and simulate the degradation of stone artifacts caused by atmospheric exposure and salt crystal accumulation, which requires realistic simulations in higher dimensions beyond existing 1D approaches.

Method: Proposes a numerical method combining finite-element space discretization with implicit-explicit time marching, extending previous 1D finite-difference framework. Includes sensitivity analysis, stability considerations, and experimental convergence analysis.

Result: The method shows good performance through convergence analysis and enables efficient 2D and 3D simulations, with numerical results presented and discussed for higher-dimensional cases.

Conclusion: The finite-element formulation with implicit-explicit time marching provides an effective approach for realistic simulations of stone degradation in multiple dimensions, outperforming previous 1D methods.

Abstract: This article investigates a space-time differential model related to the degradation of stone artifacts caused by exposure to air and atmospheric agents, which specifically lead to the accumulation of salt crystals in the material. A numerical method based on finite-element space discretization and implicit-explicit time marching is proposed as an extension of a one-dimensional finite-difference framework introduced in the literature. Within the same one-dimensional setting, a sensitivity analysis is performed, based on the techniques developed therein. They are also used as a comparison tool for the finite-element formulation, here introduced for more realistic simulations in higher space dimensions. Considerations about stability will be provided, together with an experimental convergence analysis highlighting the performance of the proposed approach. Numerical results in two and three space dimensions, obtained by an efficient code implementation, will be presented and discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve convergence of iterative solvers for linear systems from discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the monodomain model in cardiac electrophysiology, which often face computational challenges with fine meshes.

Method: Uses agglomeration-based multilevel preconditioning that creates coarser polytopic grids by aggregating elements from initial fine meshes, building a nested grid hierarchy for multilevel solver frameworks.

Result: Numerical experiments on 2D/3D domains with different ionic models and realistic geometries show strong solver effectiveness and favorable scalability with respect to polynomial degree and number of multigrid levels.

Conclusion: The agglomeration-based multilevel preconditioner is effective for accelerating cardiac electrophysiology simulations, demonstrating robust performance and scalability across various discretization parameters.

Abstract: This work presents a novel agglomeration-based multilevel preconditioner designed to accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers for linear systems arising from the discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the monodomain model in cardiac electrophysiology. The proposed approach exploits general polytopic grids at coarser levels, obtained through the agglomeration of elements from an initial, potentially fine, mesh. By leveraging a robust and efficient agglomeration strategy, we construct a nested hierarchy of grids suitable for multilevel solver frameworks. The effectiveness and performance of the methodology are assessed through a series of numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional domains, involving different ionic models and realistic unstructured geometries. The results demonstrate strong solver effectiveness and favorable scalability with respect to both the polynomial degree of the discretization and the number of levels selected in the multigrid preconditioner.

### [6] [A Fully Discrete Nonnegativity-Preserving FEM for a Stochastic Heat Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16508)
*Owen Hearder,Claude Le Bris,Ana Djurdjevac*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A fully discrete numerical method combining mass-lumped finite elements with Lie-Trotter splitting is developed for stochastic heat equations with nonlinear multiplicative noise, preserving nonnegativity and showing convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a numerical method for stochastic heat equations that preserves the nonnegativity property of the exact solution while maintaining convergence, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Combines mass-lumped finite elements (for spatial discretization) with Lie-Trotter splitting (for temporal discretization), decoupling deterministic and stochastic dynamics while preserving nonnegativity at discrete level.

Result: The method preserves nonnegativity and is proven to be convergent under suitable regularity conditions, with numerical experiments confirming convergence rates and nonnegativity preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed fully discrete method successfully preserves nonnegativity while maintaining convergence, with mass lumping ensuring nonnegativity and operator splitting effectively decoupling dynamics, though applicability beyond theoretical assumptions requires further investigation.

Abstract: We consider a stochastic heat equation with nonlinear multiplicative finite-dimensional noise that admits a unique nonnegative solution when given nonnegative initial data. Inspired by existing results for fully discrete finite difference schemes and building on the convergence analysis of semi-discrete mass-lumped finite element approximations, a fully discrete numerical method is introduced that combines mass-lumped finite elements with a Lie-Trotter splitting strategy. This discretization preserves nonnegativity at the discrete level and is shown to be convergent under suitable regularity conditions. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided, highlighting the role of mass lumping in ensuring nonnegativity and of operator splitting in decoupling the deterministic and stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm the convergence rates and the preservation of nonnegativity. In addition, we examine several numerical examples outside the scope of the established theory, aiming to explore the range of applicability and potential limitations of the proposed method.

*Sudheer Mishra,Sundararajan Natarajan,E. Natarajan,Gianmarco Manzini*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Developed an equal-order virtual element method for Stokes-Poisson-Boltzmann equations that handles complex polygonal meshes with hanging nodes without special treatment, using a novel pressure stabilization scheme derived from reformulating Laplacian drag force.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate simulation of electrokinetic phenomena in nanopore sensors and microfluidic devices requires handling coupled fluid-electrostatic interactions in geometrically complex domains with irregular boundaries and adaptive mesh refinement.

Method: Equal-order virtual element method for Stokes-Poisson-Boltzmann equations with residual-based pressure stabilization scheme. Reformulates Laplacian drag force as weighted advection term involving nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation, eliminating second-order derivatives while maintaining theoretical rigor.

Result: Proved well-posedness using Banach and Brouwer fixed-point theorems under small data assumptions. Derived optimal a priori error estimates with convergence rates O(h^k) for k≥1. Numerical experiments on diverse polygonal meshes confirm optimal convergence rates. Applications to electro-osmotic flows in nanopore sensors with complex obstacles demonstrate practical utility.

Conclusion: The method simplifies implementation through uniform polynomial treatment of all fields, offers native support for general polygonal elements, and outperforms Taylor-Hood finite element formulations for complex geometries with hanging nodes and irregular boundaries.

Abstract: Electrokinetic phenomena in nanopore sensors and microfluidic devices require accurate simulation of coupled fluid-electrostatic interactions in geometrically complex domains with irregular boundaries and adaptive mesh refinement. We develop an equal-order virtual element method for the Stokes--Poisson--Boltzmann equations that naturally handles general polygonal meshes, including meshes with hanging nodes, without requiring special treatment or remeshing. The key innovation is a residual-based pressure stabilization scheme derived by reformulating the Laplacian drag force in the momentum equation as a weighted advection term involving the nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equation, thereby eliminating second-order derivative terms while maintaining theoretical rigor. Well-posedness of the coupled stabilized problem is established using the Banach and Brouwer fixed-point theorems under sufficiently small data assumptions, and optimal a priori error estimates are derived in the energy norm with convergence rates of order $\mathcal{O}(h^k)$ for approximation degree $k \geq 1$. Numerical experiments on diverse polygonal meshes -- including distorted elements, non-convex polygons, Voronoi tessellations, and configurations with hanging nodes -- confirm optimal convergence rates, validating theoretical predictions. Applications to electro-osmotic flows in nanopore sensors with complex obstacle geometries illustrate the method's practical utility for engineering simulations. Compared to Taylor--Hood finite element formulations, the equal-order approach simplifies implementation through uniform polynomial treatment of all fields and offers native support for general polygonal elements.

### [8] [Whittle-Matérn Fields with Variable Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16581)
*Hamza Ruzayqat,Wenyu Lei,David Bolin,George Turkiyyah,Omar Knio*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a nonlocal Gaussian field model with spatially varying smoothness parameter, develops theoretical analysis of its regularity properties, and presents numerical methods for sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Whittle-Matérn Gaussian fields to allow spatially varying smoothness parameters, addressing limitations of constant-order pseudodifferential models and enabling more flexible spatial modeling.

Method: Define a nonlocal operator with kernel based on modified Bessel function, where local singularity is controlled by symmetric exponent β(x,y) = (s(x)+s(y))/2. Develop variational framework, prove existence/uniqueness of weak solutions, analyze Sobolev regularity, and implement finite-element sampling method with error estimates.

Result: Established existence/uniqueness of weak solutions on bounded domains. Derived Sobolev regularity: realizations lie in H^r(G) for every r < 2s_min - d/2, ensuring L_2(G) when s_min > d/4. Developed finite-element sampling method with error analysis and provided 1D numerical experiments showing impact of spatially varying smoothness.

Conclusion: Successfully developed a variable-order nonlocal Gaussian field model with rigorous theoretical foundation and practical numerical implementation, enabling spatially adaptive smoothness modeling with controlled regularity properties.

Abstract: We introduce and analyze a nonlocal generalization of Whittle--Matérn Gaussian fields in which the smoothness parameter varies in space through the fractional order, $s=s(x)\in[\underline{s}\,,\bar{s}]\subset(0,1)$. The model is defined via an integral-form operator whose kernel is constructed from the modified Bessel function of the second kind and whose local singularity is governed by the symmetric exponent $β(x,y)=(s(x)+s(y))/2$. This variable-order nonlocal formulation departs from the classical constant-order pseudodifferential setting and raises new analytic and numerical challenges. We develop a novel variational framework adapted to the kernel, prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions on truncated bounded domains, and derive Sobolev regularity of the Gaussian (spectral) solution controlled by the minimal local order: realizations lie in $H^r(G)$ for every $r<2\underline{s}-\tfrac{d}{2}$ (here $H^r(G)$ denotes the Sobolev space on the bounded domain $G$), hence in $L_2(G)$ when $\underline s>d/4$. We also present a finite-element sampling method for the integral model, derive error estimates, and provide numerical experiments in one dimension that illustrate the impact of spatially varying smoothness on samples covariances. Computational aspects and directions for scalable implementations are discussed.

### [9] [Discrete reliability for high-order Crouzeix--Raviart finite elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16588)
*Nis-Erik Bohne,Stefan A. Sauter*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analysis of adaptive numerical solution for 2D Poisson problem using Crouzeix-Raviart elements of odd degree k≥1, proving discrete reliability axiom for optimal convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend adaptive finite element analysis from lowest-order CR₁ FEM to higher odd-degree Crouzeix-Raviart elements (CRₖ FEM) for solving 2D Poisson problems, establishing theoretical foundations for adaptive algorithms with optimal convergence rates.

Method: Introduces residual-type a posteriori error estimator for CRₖ FEM discretization, develops new local quasi-interpolation operators specific to CRₖ FEM, and proves Axiom 3 (discrete reliability) within the established "axioms of adaptivity" framework.

Result: Successfully proves discrete reliability for CRₖ FEM of arbitrary odd degree k≥1, generalizing existing results from CR₁ to higher degrees, and demonstrates optimal convergence rates through numerical experiments for various odd k values.

Conclusion: The adaptive CRₖ FEM algorithm achieves optimal convergence rates for 2D Poisson problems across all considered odd degrees k≥1, with the theoretical proof of discrete reliability providing the foundation for this performance.

Abstract: In this paper, the adaptive numerical solution of a 2D Poisson model problem by Crouzeix-Raviart elements ($\operatorname*{CR}_{k}$ $\operatorname*{FEM}$) of arbitrary odd degree $k\geq1$ is investigated. The analysis is based on an established, abstract theoretical framework: the \textit{axioms of adaptivity} imply optimal convergence rates for the adaptive algorithm induced by a residual-type a posteriori error estimator. Here, we introduce the error estimator for the $\operatorname*{CR}_{k}$ $\operatorname*{FEM}$ discretization and our main theoretical result is the proof ot Axiom 3: \textit{discrete reliability}. This generalizes results for adaptive lowest order $\operatorname*{CR}_{1}$ $\operatorname*{FEM}$ in the literature. For this analysis, we introduce and analyze new local quasi-interpolation operators for $\operatorname*{CR}_{k}$ $\operatorname*{FEM}$ which are key for our proof of discrete reliability. We present the results of numerical experiments for the adaptive version of $\operatorname*{CR}_{k}$ $\operatorname*{FEM}$ for some low and higher (odd) degrees $k\geq1$ which illustrate the optimal convergence rates for all considered values of $k$.

### [10] [Fast Ewald Summation using Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16591)
*Erik Boström,Anna-Karin Tornberg,Ludvig af Klinteberg*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: PSWF-based Ewald summation achieves higher accuracy with fewer Fourier modes and smaller window supports than Gaussian/B-spline methods by using prolate spheroidal wavefunctions as optimal mollifiers and window functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast Ewald summation is widely used in molecular dynamics but its accuracy and computational cost depend critically on the choice of mollifier and window function. Existing approaches using Gaussian or B-spline functions are suboptimal.

Method: Uses the first prolate spheroidal wavefunction (PSWF) as both mollifier and window function due to its optimal concentration in real and Fourier space simultaneously. Provides complete method description, rigorous error estimates, and closed-form approximations for Fourier truncation and aliasing errors.

Result: PSWF-based Ewald summation achieves given accuracy with significantly fewer Fourier modes and smaller window supports than Gaussian- and B-spline-based approaches. Numerical experiments confirm the analysis.

Conclusion: PSWF-based Ewald summation provides a superior alternative to existing Ewald methods for particle simulations, offering better computational efficiency and accuracy control through optimal function choice and explicit parameter selection.

Abstract: Fast Ewald summation efficiently evaluates Coulomb interactions and is widely used in molecular dynamics simulations. It is based on a split into a short-range and a long-range part, where evaluation of the latter is accelerated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The accuracy and computational cost depend critically on the mollifier in the Ewald split and the window function used in the spreading and interpolation steps that enable the use of the FFT. The first prolate spheroidal wavefunction (PSWF) has optimal concentration in real and Fourier space simultaneously, and is used when defining both a mollifier and a window function. We provide a complete description of the method and derive rigorous error estimates. In addition, we obtain closed-form approximations of the Fourier truncation and aliasing errors, yielding explicit parameter choices for the achieved error to closely match the prescribed tolerance. Numerical experiments confirm the analysis: PSWF-based Ewald summation achieves a given accuracy with significantly fewer Fourier modes and smaller window supports than Gaussian- and B-spline-based approaches, providing a superior alternative to existing Ewald methods for particle simulations.

### [11] [Weak--strong uniqueness for bi-fluid compressible system with algebraic closure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15970)
*Yang Li,Mária Lukáčová-Medvid'ová,Milan Pokorný,Ewelina Zatorska*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes weak-strong uniqueness for a two-fluid compressible viscous system using relative entropy method, overcoming challenges from nonlinear transport of volume fraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work established global-in-time weak solutions (Novotný & Pokorný, 2020) and local-in-time strong solutions (Piasecki & Zatorska, 2022) for a two-fluid compressible viscous system. The motivation is to bridge these results by proving weak-strong uniqueness, which ensures that weak solutions coincide with strong solutions when both exist.

Method: The authors use the relative entropy method to prove weak-strong uniqueness. This involves deriving a relative entropy inequality and carefully handling troublesome terms arising from the nonlinear transport equation for the volume fraction. The key innovation is making elaborate use of the system's structure to close the estimates.

Result: The paper successfully establishes the weak-strong uniqueness principle for the two-fluid compressible viscous system. This means that when a strong solution exists, any weak solution with the same initial data must coincide with it on the time interval of existence of the strong solution.

Conclusion: The weak-strong uniqueness principle is proven for the two-fluid compressible viscous system, despite the challenging nonlinear transport of volume fraction. This result connects the previously established existence theories for weak and strong solutions, providing a more complete mathematical understanding of the system's behavior.

Abstract: We consider a real two-fluid system of compressible viscous fluids with a common velocity field and algebraic closure for the pressure law. The constitutive relation involves densities of both fluids through an implicit function. The existence of global-in-time finite energy weak solutions to this system is known since the work of Novotný and Pokorný [Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 2020]. On the other hand, existence of local-in-time strong solutions is due to Piasecki and Zatorska [J. Math Fluid Mech.,, 2022]. In this paper, we establish the weak--strong uniqueness principle using the relative entropy method. In sharp contrast to the two-phase model of Baer-Nunziato type, the volume fraction of phase $+$ obeys a transport equation with an additional nonlinear term. This gives rise to troublesome terms in the relative entropy inequality. We are able to close the estimate by making an elaborate use of the structure of the system.

### [12] [The lingering phenomenon and pattern formation in a nonlocal population model with cognitive map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16022)
*Kyung-Han Choi,Thomas Hillen*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: A population model with cognitive map dynamics shows that intermediate forgetting rates maximize density peaks near best locations (lingering), creating a trade-off between lingering and total population size under logistic growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how cognitive time scales (memorization and forgetting rates) influence individual movement paths and population-level patterns, particularly how these cognitive processes shape spatial heterogeneity and population dynamics.

Method: Propose and analyze a nonlocal population model with cognitive map dynamics. The model uses Fokker-Planck type diffusion driven by a cognitive map that stores habitat quality information nonlocally. The map updates through local presence with learning/forgetting rates, using both truncated and normalized perception kernels. Study movement-only system, then couple with logistic growth, proving well-posedness, persistence, and analyzing steady states.

Result: Finite perceptual range creates spatial heterogeneity in cognitive maps even in nearly homogeneous habitats. On unimodal landscapes, for fixed high learning rate, peak density near best location is maximized at intermediate forgetting rate (lingering phenomenon). Under logistic growth, lingering persists and reveals trade-off: near strongest-lingering regime, total population can fall below total resource, unlike classical random diffusive-logistic models.

Conclusion: Cognitive time scales significantly shape population patterns through lingering effects. Intermediate forgetting rates optimize local density peaks but create trade-offs with total population size, demonstrating that cognitive constraints fundamentally alter population dynamics compared to purely random movement models.

Abstract: The rates at which individuals memorize and forget environmental information strongly influence their movement paths and long-term space use. To understand how these cognitive time scales shape population-level patterns, we propose and analyze a nonlocal population model with a cognitive map. The population density moves by a Fokker--Planck type diffusion driven by a cognitive map that stores a habitat quality information nonlocally. The map is updated through local presence with learning and forgetting rates, and we consider both truncated and normalized perception kernels.
  We first study the movement-only system without growth. We show that finite perceptual range generates spatial heterogeneity in the cognitive map even in nearly homogeneous habitats, and we prove a lingering phenomenon on unimodal landscapes: for the fixed high learning rate, the peak density near the best location is maximized at an intermediate forgetting rate.
  We then couple cognitive diffusion to logistic growth. We establish local well-posedness and persistence by proving instability of the extinction equilibrium and the existence of a positive steady state, with uniqueness under an explicit condition on the motility function. Numerical simulations show that lingering persists under logistic growth and reveal a trade-off between the lingering and total population size, since near the strongest-lingering regime the total mass can fall below the total resource, in contrast to classical random diffusive--logistic models.

*Ujjal Das,Luca Fanelli,Luz Roncal*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes quantitative unique continuation at infinity for Dirac equations with bounded matrix-valued potentials, proving sharp Landis-type estimates for solution decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the vanishing order of solutions to Dirac equations at infinity, which has implications for unique continuation properties and spectral theory of Dirac operators.

Method: Uses a Bourgain-Kenig type approach based on Carleman inequalities for Dirac operators, combined with local Hölder regularity results. Also employs symmetry assumptions in 2D for improved estimates.

Result: Proves sharp lower bound of order exp(-κR²(log R)²) for vanishing order of nontrivial bounded solutions as |x|=R→∞. Shows improved estimates in 2D under symmetry assumptions, and derives qualitative Landis-type results for decaying potentials.

Conclusion: The paper establishes optimal quantitative unique continuation results for Dirac equations, with the quadratic growth in the exponent being sharp. The methods extend to various settings including symmetry assumptions and decaying potentials.

Abstract: We study quantitative unique continuation at infinity for Dirac equations with bounded matrix-valued potentials. For the massless Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we establish a Landis-type estimate showing that the vanishing order of any nontrivial bounded solution of $( \mathcal{D}_n + \mathbb{V} ) \varphi = 0$ satisfies a lower bound of order $\exp(-κR^{2} (\log R)^{2})$ as $|x|=R\to \infty$; the quadratic growth in the exponent is sharp, in view of previous known results. Our proof follows a Bourgain--Kenig type approach based on a Carleman inequality for Dirac operators which relies on a local Hölder regularity result, which we also prove. In two dimension, we obtain improved quantitative estimates under symmetry assumptions on the potential $\mathbb{V}$ and for real-valued solutions. Finally, we also derive qualitative Landis-type results for Dirac equations with decaying potentials, including critical decay rates.

### [14] [An intrinsic expansion approach to the Galerkin approximations for the Navier-Stokes equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16064)
*Luan Hoang,Michael S. Jolly*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Galerkin approximations of 3D Navier-Stokes equations, showing convergence and asymptotic expansions for both steady-state and time-dependent solutions as dimension increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the convergence behavior of Galerkin approximations for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations as the dimension of approximation spaces goes to infinity, and to characterize the asymptotic structure of these approximations.

Method: Study Galerkin approximations in finite-dimensional spaces, analyze convergence to Navier-Stokes solutions, and derive asymptotic expansions in nested function spaces for both steady-state and time-dependent cases.

Result: For converging sequences of Galerkin solutions, obtain subsequences with intrinsic asymptotic expansions in appropriate nested function spaces, leading to expansions in standard Sobolev or Sobolev-Lebesgue spaces, with relations among leading terms for steady states.

Conclusion: Galerkin approximations of 3D Navier-Stokes equations exhibit structured asymptotic expansions when converging to solutions, providing insight into approximation behavior and convergence rates in high-dimensional limits.

Abstract: We study the Galerkin approximation of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we examine the convergence of these solutions in a sequence of finite dimensional spaces as the dimension goes to infinity. For any sequence of steady state or, respectively, time dependent Galerkin solutions that converges to a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, we obtain a subsequence with an intrinsic asymptotic expansion in appropriate nested function spaces. Consequently, an induced asymptotic expansion is obtained in a more standard spatial Sobolev or, respectively, spatiotemporal Sobolev-Lebesgue space. In the case of steady states, we establish certain relations among leading terms of this expansion.

*Oscar Riaño,Alex D Rodriguez,Svetlana Roudenko*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies 1D nonlinear Schrödinger equations with power-sum nonlinearities, establishing local well-posedness without Strichartz estimates, extending to global solutions via pseudo-conformal transformation for quadratic phase data, proving scattering for large positive b, and showing rich dynamics beyond ground state thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish well-posedness theory for NLS with general nonlinearities expressed as sums of powers (including infinite sums), enabling treatment of exponential, sine, and cosine nonlinearities for the first time, and to understand the richer dynamics beyond traditional ground state thresholds.

Method: Uses Cazenave-Naumkin approach for local well-posedness without Strichartz estimates, applies pseudo-conformal transformation to extend to global solutions for quadratic phase data, analyzes asymptotic behavior and scattering for large positive b, and includes numerical simulations for various nonlinearities.

Result: Proves local well-posedness for any positive powers in weighted H¹ classes, global existence for quadratic phase data, scattering for large positive b, and demonstrates that ground states no longer provide sharp thresholds for scattering vs. blow-up, revealing richer dynamics.

Conclusion: The framework handles infinite sum nonlinearities including exponential cases, establishes comprehensive well-posedness theory, reveals complex dynamics beyond traditional thresholds, and opens new directions for studying NLS with general nonlinearities.

Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation $$ iu_t + u_{xx} + \mathcal{N}(u)u=0, \quad x,t \in \mathbb R, $$ with the nonlinearity term that is expressed as a sum of powers, possibly infinite: $$ \mathcal{N}(u) = \sum d_k |u|^{α_k}, \quad α_k > 0. $$
  We first investigate the local well-posedness of this equation for any positive powers of $α_k$ in a certain weighted class of initial data, subset of $H^1 (\mathbb R)$. For that we use an approach of Cazenave-Naumkin [19], thus, avoiding any Strichartz estimates. Then, using the pseudo-conformal transformation, we extend the local result to the global one for the initial data with a quadratic phase. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of such global solutions and prove scattering for data with the quadratic phase $e^{ib|x|^2}$ with sufficiently large positive $b$, in $H^1(\mathbb R)$. One of the advantages of considering an infinite sum in the nonlinearity term is being able to consider exponential nonlinearities, such as $e^{γ|u|^{k}} u$, as well as sine or cosine nonlinearities, and obtain well-posedness in those cases, the first such result for most of those nonlinearities.
  To conclude, we show numerical simulations for various examples of combined nonlinearities, including the double nonlinearity and an exponential one, then investigate the behavior of solutions with positive or negative initial $b$ in a quadratic phase data. Furthermore, we also show that a ground state in the NLS equation with combined nonlinearities no longer provides a sharp threshold for global behavior such as scattering vs. finite time blow-up, instead the equation has a much richer dynamics.

*Xiaoding Yang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Global existence and exponential convergence to equilibrium for a gravity-capillary Navier-Stokes system with dynamic contact angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish stability and long-time behavior of equilibrium configurations for incompressible viscous fluids with free surfaces, gravity, and capillary forces, where contact points can move freely with dynamic contact angles.

Method: Develop a framework of a priori estimates for the Navier-Stokes system with free boundary, gravity, and capillary forces. Prove global existence and exponential convergence to equilibrium for initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium states.

Result: For initial data near equilibrium, the system admits global solutions that converge exponentially fast to a (horizontally) shifted equilibrium state.

Conclusion: The gravity-capillary Navier-Stokes system with dynamic contact angles is stable near equilibrium, with solutions converging exponentially to shifted equilibrium configurations.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of an incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes fluid evolving above a one-dimensional flat surface. The fluid is subject to a uniform gravitational field and capillary forces acting along the free boundary. The interface between the fluid and the surrounding air is a free surface whose motion is driven by gravity, surface tension, and the fluid velocity field. The triple-phase intersections where the fluid, the air above the vessel, and the solid vessel wall meet are referred to as contact points, and the angles formed there are called contact angles. The model under consideration incorporates boundary conditions that allow for full motion of the contact points and dynamic contact angles. Under these conditions, \cite{Yang} established the existence of equilibrium configurations for the model. These equilibria consist of a quiescent fluid occupying a domain whose upper boundary can be represented as the graph of a function in polar coordinates, minimizing a gravity-capillary energy functional subject to a fixed mass constraint. The equilibrium contact angles may take any value in $(0,π)$ depending on the choice of capillary parameters. In the present work, we develop a framework of a priori estimates for this model. We prove that, for initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium, the system admits global solutions that converge exponentially fast to a (horizontally) shifted equilibrium state.

To establish the existence of solutions, we employ a penalization technique in the sense of Del Pino and Felmer adapted to a locally Lipschitz functional. Furthermore, by combining variational methods with Moser-type iteration techniques, we obtain the concentration behavior of the solutions. Our results contribute to the study of nonlinear elliptic problems with irregular nonlinearities and critical growth phenomena.

*Zhen-Feng Jin,Weimin Zhang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies normalized solutions (solutions with prescribed L²-norm) to a semilinear elliptic equation with combined power nonlinearities, establishing existence, multiplicity, and nonexistence results under various parameter regimes and domain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the existence and properties of normalized solutions (solutions with fixed L²-norm) for semilinear elliptic equations with combined power nonlinearities, which arise in various physical contexts including nonlinear optics and Bose-Einstein condensation.

Method: Uses variational methods, Lagrange multiplier technique, monotonicity trick, Pohozaev identity, moving-plane method, and continuation arguments to analyze normalized solutions under different parameter regimes and domain geometries.

Result: 1) For 2<p≤q≤critical exponent and small ρ: existence of local minimizer. 2) For μ≥0 and star-shaped domains: existence of second mountain pass solution. 3) For μ≥0, N≥3, 1<p≤2, q≥max{critical exponent, 3} and convex domains: nonexistence for large ρ. 4) For μ=0, N≥3, q=critical exponent in balls: dichotomy result for Brézis-Nirenberg problem.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of normalized solutions for elliptic equations with combined nonlinearities, revealing how existence, multiplicity, and nonexistence depend on parameter ranges, domain geometry, and norm constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence, multiplicity and nonexistence of solutions for the following equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \begin{aligned} &-Δu+ωu=μu^{p-1}+u^{q-1},~ u>0 \quad &&\text { in } Ω, \\ &u=0 &&\text { on } \partialΩ, \\ \end{aligned} \end{cases} \end{equation*} with prescribed $L^2$-norm $\|u\|_2^2=ρ$, where $N\ge 1$, $ρ>0$, $μ\in \mathbb{R}$, $1<p\le q$, and $Ω\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded smooth domain. The parameter $ω\in\mathbb{R}$ arises as a Lagrange multiplier. Firstly, when $2<p\le q\le \frac{2N}{(N-2)^+}$ and $ρ$ is small, we establish the existence of a local minimizer of energy. Furthermore, when $μ\ge 0$ and $Ω$ is a star-shaped domain, using the monotonicity trick and the Pohozaev identity, we show that there exists a second solution which is of mountain pass type. Secondly, when $μ\ge 0$, $N\ge 3$, $1<p\le 2$, $q\ge \max\left\{\frac{2N}{N-2}, 3\right\}$ and $Ω$ is a convex domain, using the moving-plane method, we prove the nonexistence of normalized solutions for large $ρ$. Finally, when $μ=0$, $N\ge 3$, $q=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ and $Ω$ is a ball, we give a dichotomy result of normalized solutions for the Brézis-Nirenberg problem by continuation arguments.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper establishes time decay properties for linear damped wave equations and investigates semilinear versions with Riesz potential nonlinearities in pseudo-measure spaces, deriving a new critical exponent for global existence vs. blow-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the time decay behavior of solutions to damped wave equations in pseudo-measure spaces and establish critical exponents for global existence versus finite-time blow-up in semilinear problems with Riesz potential nonlinearities.

Method: Analyzes linear damped wave equations in L² and Sobolev spaces, then studies semilinear equations with Riesz potential-type power nonlinearities I_γ(|u|^p) using pseudo-measure spaces Y^q framework, deriving critical exponent p_crit(n,q,γ).

Result: Establishes time decay properties for linear equations, proves global existence of small-data Sobolev solutions when p ≥ p_crit, shows finite-time blow-up for 1 < p < p_crit, and provides sharp lifespan estimates in subcritical regime.

Conclusion: The paper successfully characterizes the critical behavior of damped wave equations with Riesz potential nonlinearities in pseudo-measure spaces, providing a complete picture of global existence versus blow-up with precise lifespan estimates.

Abstract: In this paper, our primary objective is to establish the time decay properties of solutions $u(t, x)$ with initial data $u_0, u_1 \in \mathcal{Y}^q$ (pseudo-measure spaces) to the linear damped wave equation in the spaces $L^2\left(\mathbb{R}^n\right)$ and $\dot{H}^s\left(\mathbb{R}^n\right)$ (for $s \leq 0$ or $s \geq 0$). Our subsequent aim is to investigate the semilinear damped wave equation with a Riesz potential-type power nonlinearity $\mathcal{I}_γ\left(|u|^p\right)$, where $γ\in [0, n)$, and initial data belonging to pseudo-measure spaces $\mathcal{Y}^q$. In addition, we derive a new critical exponent $p=p_{\mathrm{crit}}(n, q, γ):=1+\frac{2+γ}{n-q}$ for some $q \in\left(0, \frac{n}{2}\right)$ and in low spatial dimensions, within the framework of pseudo-measure spaces $\mathcal{Y}^q$. Specifically, we prove the global (in time) existence of small-data Sobolev solutions with low regularity when $p \geq p_{\mathrm{crit}}(n, q, γ)$, and the finite-time blow-up of weak solutions, even for small initial data, whenever $1< p<p_{\mathrm{crit}}(n, q, γ)$. Moreover, in order to characterize the blow-up time more precisely, we establish sharp upper and lower bound estimates for the lifespan of solutions in the subcritical regime.

*Rui Chen,Bo Li*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies large-time asymptotics for heat and fractional heat equations on discrete lattices and finite subgraphs, providing unified theory for local and nonlocal diffusions with sharp decay rates and convergence results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive discrete theory of long-time asymptotics for both local (s=1) and nonlocal (0<s<1) diffusion processes on discrete structures, bridging continuous and discrete analysis.

Method: Uses Cauchy problem approach with fractional Laplacian on ℤ^d and finite subgraphs; employs sharp translation-increment bounds for lattice fractional heat kernel; analyzes spectral decomposition for finite graphs; studies positivity improving properties of semigroups.

Result: Derives precise first-order asymptotic expansion toward lattice fractional heat kernel; obtains optimal decay rate t^{-1/(2s)} in ℓ^p-asymptotics under finite first moment; proves convergence in full ℓ^1-class without moment assumptions; establishes exponential large-time behavior for finite graphs with spectral gap analysis.

Conclusion: Provides unified discrete theory for long-time asymptotics of local and nonlocal diffusions, with sharp quantitative results for lattice settings and spectral characterization for finite graphs, including positivity properties of associated semigroups.

Abstract: In this paper, we study large-time asymptotics for heat and fractional heat equations in two discrete settings: the full lattice \(\mathbb Z^d\) and finite connected subgraphs with Dirichlet boundary condition. These results provide a unified discrete theory of long-time asymptotics for local and nonlocal diffusions.
  For \(d\ge1\) and \(s\in(0,1]\), we consider on \(\mathbb Z^d\) the Cauchy problem \[ \partial_t u+(-Δ)^s u=0,\qquad u(0)=u_0\in \ell^1(\mathbb Z^d), \] and derive a precise first-order asymptotic expansion toward the lattice fractional heat kernel \(G_t^{(s)}\). The main technical input is a pair of sharp translation-increment bounds for \(G_t^{(s)}\): a pointwise estimate and an \(\ell^1\)-estimate. As consequences, under finite first moment we obtain the optimal decay rate \(t^{-1/(2s)}\) in \(\ell^p\)-asymptotics (\(1\le p\le\infty\)), and we prove sharpness by explicit shifted-kernel examples. Without moment assumptions, we still establish convergence in the full \(\ell^1\)-class, and we show that no universal quantitative rate can hold in general.
  We also analyze fractional Dirichlet diffusion on finite connected subgraphs (restricted fractional setting, including \(s=1\) as the local case). In this finite-dimensional framework, solutions admit spectral decomposition and exhibit exponential large-time behavior governed by the principal eigenvalue and the spectral gap. In addition, we study positivity improving properties of the associated semigroups for both the lattice and Dirichlet evolutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze heat equations governed by mixed local-nonlocal diffusion operators with spatially irregular coefficients, addressing the challenge of handling coefficients that are not smooth but only bounded and measurable or even distributional.

Method: First establish classical well-posedness in energy framework for bounded measurable coefficients with uniform positivity, then extend to distributional coefficients using Friedrichs-type regularization procedure to construct solution nets.

Result: Proved existence and uniqueness of classical solutions for regular coefficients, and existence/uniqueness of solution nets for distributional coefficients, with consistency between frameworks when coefficients are regular.

Conclusion: Successfully developed a comprehensive framework for mixed local-nonlocal heat equations that handles both classical and distributional coefficients, providing robust solution theory for irregular coefficient problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for a heat equation governed by a mixed local--nonlocal diffusion operator with spatially irregular coefficients. We first establish classical well-posedness in an energy framework for bounded, measurable coefficients that satisfy uniform positivity, and we derive an a priori estimate ensuring uniqueness and continuous dependence on the initial data. We then extend the notion of solution to distributional coefficients and initial data by a Friedrichs-type regularisation procedure. Within this very weak framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solution nets and prove consistency with the classical weak solution whenever the coefficients are regular.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Study of global Gevrey hypoellipticity for first-order differential operators on M×𝕋^m, where M is non-compact manifold diffeomorphic to interior of compact manifold with boundary, establishing sharp criteria in terms of rationality and exponential Liouville behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand global Gevrey hypoellipticity for differential operators on product manifolds with torus factors, extending regularity theory to Gevrey classes (Roumieu and Beurling types) beyond analytic and C^∞ settings.

Method: Construct scattering metric on M with Gevrey coefficients, use Hodge theory to obtain Gevrey regularity for harmonic forms, analyze operators under natural conditions on defining closed 1-forms.

Result: Obtain sharp criterion for global Gevrey hypoellipticity in terms of rationality and (Roumieu/Beurling) exponential Liouville behavior for s>1 Gevrey classes.

Conclusion: Global Gevrey hypoellipticity can be characterized precisely using rationality conditions and exponential Liouville behavior, with the scattering metric construction and Hodge theory providing key technical tools for the analysis.

Abstract: We investigate the global Gevrey hypoellipticity of a class of first-order differential operators associated with tube-type involutive structures on $M\times\mathbb{T}^m$, where $M$ is a non-compact manifold diffeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with boundary and $\mathbb{T}^m$ is the $m$-dimensional torus. For $s>1$, we work in Gevrey classes of Roumieu and Beurling type. A key step is the construction, on $M$, of a scattering metric whose coefficients are Gevrey of order $s$ in every analytic chart; this allows us to use Hodge theory and obtain Gevrey regularity for the harmonic forms. Under a natural condition on the defining closed $1$-forms, we obtain a sharp criterion for global Gevrey hypoellipticity in terms of rationality and (Roumieu/Beurling) exponential Liouville behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model reactive transport in porous media with thin, highly heterogeneous fractures where aperture and obstacle patterns vary periodically, requiring multiscale analysis as fractures collapse to interfaces.

Method: Multiscale analysis as ε→0 for fracture thickness, deriving homogenized model via asymptotic expansion, including boundary-layer correctors and energy norm error estimates.

Result: Derived new homogenized model: bulk diffusion-reaction equations coupled through nonlinear interface conditions with first-order semilinear hyperbolic system on interface; proved well-posedness, regularity, and quantitative error estimates.

Conclusion: Successfully developed rigorous multiscale framework for reactive transport in fractured porous media, providing effective interface-coupled model with proven mathematical properties and approximation accuracy.

Abstract: We study nonlinear reactive transport in a layered porous medium separated by an $\varepsilon$-thin, highly heterogeneous fracture whose aperture and obstacle pattern vary periodically. Species transport in the bulk is governed by parabolic reaction--diffusion equations, coupled to a convection-diffusion-reaction problem in the fracture with nonlinear wall and obstacle reactions and Peclet number of order $O(\varepsilon^{-1})$. Via multiscale analysis as $\varepsilon \to 0$, when the fracture collapses to a flat interface, we derive a new type of homogenized model consisting of bulk diffusion--reaction equations coupled through nonlinear interface conditions and a first-order semilinear hyperbolic system on the interface. We prove well-posedness and regularity of the limit system, construct a multiscale approximation with boundary-layer correctors, and derive quantitative error estimates in suitable energy norms.

TL;DR: Uniqueness and structural stability of parallel flows in 2D channels without flux restrictions, using refined McLeod approach to show linearized operator invertibility for non-reversal Couette-Poiseuille solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish uniqueness and structural stability of parallel flows in 2D channels under perturbations, without requiring restrictions on flux size, addressing limitations in existing results.

Method: Extends and refines J.B. McLeod's approach to demonstrate continuous invertibility of linearized operator at generic Couette-Poiseuille solutions without flow reversal, then deduces local uniqueness and nonlinear structural stability.

Result: Proves local uniqueness and nonlinear structural stability of non-reversal Couette-Poiseuille solutions under small external forces, establishes uniqueness "in the large" for symmetric solutions, and provides counterexample showing linearized operator loses invertibility with flow reversal.

Conclusion: Non-reversal Couette-Poiseuille solutions are uniquely determined and structurally stable without flux restrictions, but flow reversal breaks linearized operator invertibility, highlighting the importance of the no-reversal condition.

Abstract: We establish uniqueness and structural stability of a class of parallel flows in a 2D straight, infinite channel, under perturbations with either globally or locally bounded Dirichlet integrals. The significant feature of our result is that it does not require any restriction on the size of the flux characterizing the flow. Precisely, by extending and refining an approach initially introduced by J.B. McLeod, we demonstrate the continuous invertibility of the linearized operator at a generic Couette-Poiseuille solution that does not exhibit flow reversal. We then deduce local uniqueness of these solutions as well as their nonlinear structural stability under small external forces. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness of certain class of Couette-Poiseuille solutions ``in the large," within the set of solutions possessing natural symmetry. Finally, we bring an example showing that, in general, if the flow reversal assumption is violated, the linearized operator is no longer invertible.

TL;DR: The paper develops a procedure to transform ensemble bounds from probabilistic PDE solutions into individual pathwise controls, with applications to NLS equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic approaches to PDEs provide ensemble bounds, but transforming these into individual controls on the flow is important for understanding long-time behavior of solutions.

Method: Constructs an estimation procedure with a flexible local requirement that can be fulfilled using the ensemble bound itself, differing from Bourgain's approach that relied on local wellposedness with time of size-doubling estimates.

Result: The procedure provides new pathwise controls on solutions to nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equations.

Conclusion: The developed method successfully transforms ensemble bounds into individual controls, offering a more flexible alternative to existing approaches for analyzing long-time behavior of probabilistic PDE solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we build a procedure that allows to establish regularity and controls in time for probabilistic solutions to PDEs. Probabilistic approaches to global wellposedness problems usually provide ensemble bounds on the solutions. These bounds are the main tools to ensure convergence procedures yielding the existence and uniqueness of global solutions. A question of interest consists in transforming such ensemble bounds into individual controls on the flow ; this, among other uses, gives valuable information on the long-time behavior of the solutions. Toward such question of bounds transformation, Bourgain initiated a successful procedure that exploited the local wellposedness of the PDE, with an estimate of the time of size-doubling. In this note, we construct an estimation procedure which relies on a different local requirement. It turns out that this substitute is flexible enough to be possible to fulfill with the help of the ensemble bound itself. For applications of the procedure, we are able to provide new pathwise controls on solutions to NLS equations.

Result: Constructed sequence of sign-changing solutions with increasing unbounded energies that converge to limiting system solutions in H¹-norm, and concentrate around prescribed attraction points in both H¹ and Lq norms.

Conclusion: The paper establishes existence and concentration properties of sign-changing solutions for competitive Schrödinger systems with shrinking localized potentials, connecting them to limiting system solutions.

Abstract: We study a competitive nonlinear Schrödinger system in $\mathbb{R}^N$ whose nonlinear potential is localized in small regions that shrink to isolated points. Within a variational framework based on a fully sign-changing Nehari constraint and Krasnosel'skii genus, we construct, for all $\varepsilon>0$, a sequence of sign-changing solutions with increasing and unbounded energies, and after suitable translations they converge to a sequence of sign-changing solutions of the associated limiting system as $\varepsilon\to 0$ in $H^1$-norm. Moreover, these sign-changing solutions concentrate around the prescribed attraction points both in $H^1$-norm and $L^q$-norm for $q\in [1,\infty]$.

Conclusion: The paper establishes existence results for ground state solutions of singular nonlinear Schrödinger equations with periodic potentials using innovative variational techniques and profile decomposition.

Abstract: We study the existence of solutions of the following nonlinear Schrödinger equation $$ -Δu+V(x)u-\frac{(N-2)^2}{4|x|^2}u=f(x,u) $$ where $V:\mathbb{R}^N\to\mathbb{R}$ and $f:\mathbb{R}^N\times \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ are periodic with respect to $x\in\mathbb{R}^N.$ We assume that $V$ has positive essential infimum, $f$ satisfies weak growth conditions and $N\geq 3$.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Stability analysis of self-similar solutions for thin-film equation with linear mobility and gravity term, proving algebraic convergence rate t^{-1/5} without explicit profile representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze stability of self-similar solutions in thin-film equations with gravity stabilization, developing methods that don't rely on explicit algebraic representations of profiles.

Method: Reformulate in mass-Lagrangian coordinates, exploit gradient-flow structure with weighted L^2 inner product using self-similar profile as weight. Establish coercivity of Hessian, combine maximal-regularity estimates for linearized evolution with nonlinear term estimates.

Result: Prove convergence of perturbations to self-similar profile at algebraic rate t^{-1/5} in arbitrary weighted Sobolev norms. Approach works without explicit profile representation, using only ODE and boundary asymptotics.

Conclusion: Developed flexible toolbox for stability analysis of special solutions in more general equations, moving beyond perturbative regimes and explicit profile representations used in previous thin-film and porous-medium equation studies.

Abstract: We consider the thin-film equation with linear mobility and a stabilizing second-order porous-medium type term modeling gravity. The model admits self-similar solutions, and our goal is to analyze their stability. We reformulate the problem in mass-Lagrangian coordinates and exploit the underlying gradient-flow structure of the equation with respect to a weighted $L^2$ inner product, where the weight is given by the self-similar source-type profile. This framework allows us to establish a coercivity result for the Hessian (the linearization around the self-similar solution) in a suitably weighted inner product. As a consequence, we prove the convergence of perturbations toward the self-similar profile at an algebraic rate of order $t^{-\frac 1 5}$, in arbitrary scales of weighted Sobolev norms. The analysis relies on maximal-regularity estimates for the linearized evolution, combined with appropriate estimates for the nonlinear terms.
  Notably, beyond perturbative regimes and in contrast to previous results for the thin-film equation (convergence to the Smyth-Hill profile) or the porous-medium equation (convergence to the Barenblatt-Pattle solution), our analysis does not rely on an explicit (algebraic) representation of the self-similar profile. Instead, it is based solely on a systematic use of the ordinary differential equation satisfied by the self-similar solution, together with a careful analysis of its boundary asymptotics. As a result, we expect that the approach developed here can serve as a flexible toolbox for the study of more general classes of equations and for the stability analysis of special solutions in future work.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper develops new techniques to prove symmetry and monotonicity properties of positive solutions to semilinear elliptic equations with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions in symmetric domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend symmetry analysis from purely Dirichlet boundary conditions to mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, which presents additional challenges due to the Neumann boundary component.

Method: Three main techniques: 1) Establishing a maximum principle for mixed-boundary problems in small domains; 2) Using local analysis of angular derivatives (Hartman-Wintner technique) to prove non-vanishing of tangential derivatives along Neumann boundaries; 3) Determining signs of directional derivatives along moving lines. These are combined with the moving plane method.

Result: Successfully applies the new techniques to prove symmetry and monotonicity results for positive solutions in planar sub-spherical sectors when the amplitude is ≤ 2π/3.

Conclusion: The paper introduces innovative analytical tools that overcome challenges specific to mixed boundary conditions, enabling symmetry analysis in domains with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries, with applications demonstrated in sector domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the symmetry properties of positive solutions $u$ to a semilinear elliptic equation under mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions in symmetric domains. First, we establish a maximum principle tailored to mixed-boundary problems in domains of either small volume or narrow width, thereby enabling the application of the moving plane method. Secondly, in contrast to the purely Dirichlet case, a key challenge is to establish the non-vanishing of the tangential derivative of $u$ along the Neumann boundary. To address this, we employ local analysis techniques of angular derivatives, as introduced by Hartman and Wintner [Amer. J. Math., 1953]. Thirdly, we identify the signs of directional derivatives of $u$ along sections of the moving line. Using a planar sub-spherical sector as an example, we illustrate how these new innovative techniques and the moving plane method can be combined to derive symmetry and monotonicity results, particularly when the amplitude is less than or equal to $2π/3$.

*Oluwadamilola Fasina*

TL;DR: Extension of paraproduct decompositions for compositions A(f) to finite set domains X and X×Y, constructing partition trees for scale analysis, with applications in graph signal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by graph signal processing environments where one needs to separate singular and smooth components of compositions A(f) on finite sets, extending previous work on continuous domains to discrete/finite settings.

Method: Construct partition trees on finite sets X and X×Y to enable sensible scale analysis, then extend paraproduct decompositions from previous work to these finite settings, constructing paraproduct operators Π_{A',A''}^{L,S} with specific properties.

Result: Obtain results resembling previous continuous-domain work but with finite sets as support, including construction of paraproduct operators where Δ_{L,S}(A,f) ∈ Λ_{2α}(X×Y) with bounded norm, and analogous results for single finite set X.

Conclusion: Successfully extends paraproduct decomposition theory to finite set domains, enabling separation of singular and smooth components in graph signal processing applications, with boundedness properties preserved in discrete settings.

Abstract: We outline an extension of paraproduct decompositions for compositions of the form $A(f)$ where $A \in C^{d}(\mathbb{R}), f \in Λ_α([0,1]^d)$ developed in [arXiv:2503.12629] and [arXiv:2508.13322] to settings where $(A \in C^1(\mathbb{R}),f \in Λ_α(X))$ and $ (A \in C^2(\mathbb{R}),f \in Λ_α(X \times Y))$. To do so, we construct partition trees on $X$ and $X \times Y$ such that analysis with respect to scale is sensible. We obtain results resembling those of [arXiv:2503.12629] and [arXiv:2508.13322], but with the finite sets $X$ and $X \times Y $ as support. In particular we construct the paraproduct $Π_{A',A''}^{L,S}: f \to \tilde{A}_{L,S}(f) + Δ_{L,S}(A,f)$ such that $Δ_{L,S}(A,f) \in Λ_{2α}(X \times Y)$ and $\lVert Δ_{L,S}(A,f) \rVert_{Λ_{2α}(X \times Y)} \leq C_A \lVert f \rVert_{Λ_α(X \times Y)}$. Analogous results are obtained when the support is just one finite set, $X$. This extension is motivated by situations where one wishes to separate the singular and smooth components of such compositions in graph signal processing environments.

### [32] [Development of a single-parameter spring-dashpot rolling friction model for coarse-grained DEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15887)
*Putri Mustika Widartiningsih,Yoshiharu Tsugeno,Toshiki Imatani,Yuki Tsunazawa,Mikio Sakai*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A new single-parameter rolling friction model for DEM simulations that simplifies shape approximation for non-spherical particles using critical rolling angle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DEM simulations struggle with non-spherical particles due to computational complexity. Existing rolling friction models require multiple interdependent empirical parameters that are difficult to calibrate and create parameter ambiguity.

Method: Proposes a new spring-dashpot type rolling friction model with only one parameter: critical rolling angle. This parameter is derived theoretically and characterizes the transition from static to rolling motion. The model is integrated into a coarse-grained DEM framework for large-scale applications.

Result: The model achieves numerical stability without spurious oscillations and successfully reproduces macroscopic behavior of original particle systems in DEM-CFD simulations of an incinerator system.

Conclusion: The single-parameter model simplifies implementation and calibration while enhancing DEM applicability for industrial-scale simulations involving non-spherical particles.

Abstract: Simulating granular materials composed of non-spherical particles remains a major challenge in discrete element method (DEM) simulations due to the complexity of contact detection and rotational dynamics, rendering large-scale simulations computationally prohibitive. To address this limitation, rolling friction is commonly introduced as an approximation to account for particle shape effects by applying a resistive torque to spherical particles. Among existing rolling friction formulations, the spring-dashpot (S-D) type model is widely recognized for its numerical stability and realistic representation of rolling resistance. However, conventional S-D models require multiple empirical parameters that must be calibrated in an interdependent manner, leading to increased experimental effort, parameter ambiguity, and uncertainty in practical applications. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a new S-D type rolling friction model that reduces the parameter set to a single physically meaningful quantity: the critical rolling angle. Derived from theoretical considerations, this parameter characterizes the transition from static to rolling motion at particle contacts. The use of a single parameter simplifies implementation and eliminates the need for extensive calibration. Stability analysis demonstrates that the proposed model allows particles to reach a physically consistent equilibrium state without spurious rotational oscillations. For large-scale applications, the model is further integrated into a coarse-grained DEM framework. Validation using DEM-CFD simulations of an incinerator system confirms that the proposed approach successfully reproduces the macroscopic behavior of the original particle system. Overall, this study enhances the applicability of DEM for industrial-scale simulations involving non-spherical particles.

*Md Hossain Sahadath,Qiyun Cheng,Shaowu Pan,Wei Ji*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: Neural operator surrogates (DeepONet & FNO) for neutron transport achieve high accuracy with <0.3% runtime of conventional S_N solvers, enabling efficient eigenvalue calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient surrogate models for neutron transport computations that can significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy, enabling real-time applications like digital twins and design optimization.

Method: Trained DeepONet and FNO neural operators to learn mapping from anisotropic neutron sources to angular fluxes in 1D slab geometry. Models were trained for three scattering ratios (c=0.1, 0.5, 1.0) representing different transport regimes. Surrogates were integrated into S_N k-eigenvalue solver, replacing transport sweep with single forward pass.

Result: FNO achieved higher predictive accuracy while DeepONet offered greater computational efficiency. Both provided <0.3% runtime of conventional S_N solver. In eigenvalue calculations, deviations were up to 135 pcm (DeepONet) and 112 pcm (FNO) with runtime reduced to <0.1% of S_N solver on fine grids.

Conclusion: Neural operator frameworks demonstrate strong potential as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, enabling real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations for design optimization.

Abstract: This work introduces a neural operator based surrogate modeling framework for neutron transport computation. Two architectures, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), were trained for fixed source problems to learn the mapping from anisotropic neutron sources, Q(x,μ), to the corresponding angular fluxes, ψ(x,μ), in a one-dimensional slab geometry. Three distinct models were trained for each neural operator, corresponding to different scattering ratios (c = 0.1, 0.5, & 1.0), providing insight into their performance across distinct transport regimes (absorption-dominated, moderate, and scattering-dominated). The models were subsequently evaluated on a wide range of previously unseen source configurations, demonstrating that FNO generally achieves higher predictive accuracy, while DeepONet offers greater computational efficiency. Both models offered significant speedups that become increasingly pronounced as the scattering ratio increases, requiring <0.3% of the runtime of a conventional S_N solver. The surrogate models were further incorporated into the S_N k-eigenvalue solver, replacing the computationally intensive transport sweep loop with a single forward pass. Across varying fission cross sections and spatial-angular grids, both neural operator solvers reproduced reference eigenvalues with deviations up to 135 pcm for DeepONet and 112 pcm for FNO, while reducing runtime to <0.1% of that of the S_N solver on relatively fine grids. These results demonstrate the strong potential of neural operator frameworks as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, paving the way for real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations, such as in design optimization.

*Tao Xu,Zhong-Can Ou-Yang*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A memorial review exploring biomembrane shapes through Helfrich's elastic model, connecting liquid crystal theory to biological and synthetic membrane morphologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To honor Prof. Wolfgang Helfrich's legacy by reviewing how his membrane liquid crystal model explains diverse biomembrane shapes, connecting soft matter physics to biological systems.

Method: Review approach using continuum elastic theories, particularly the Helfrich model, to analyze biomembrane shapes through analogies with crystals, soap bubbles, smectic liquid crystals, fullerenes, and peptide assemblies.

Result: Shapes like cylinders, spheres, tori, biconcave discoids, and Delaunay surfaces form a geometric group independent of biomembrane equations, emerging when pressure, surface tension, and bending modules meet specific conditions.

Conclusion: Continuum elastic theories, especially Helfrich's model, provide a unifying framework for understanding diverse membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems, demonstrating the power of soft matter physics in membrane science.

Abstract: It is with great regret that Prof. Wolfgang Helfrich passed away on 28 September 2025 in Berlin. As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems.

TL;DR: Comparison of evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective molecular design of nonlinear optical materials, showing NSGA-II produces high-quality molecules while MOME explores wider chemical space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discovering better nonlinear optical (NLO) molecules is computationally challenging due to vast chemical space and competing objectives, requiring efficient multi-objective optimization methods.

Method: Compare evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II, MAP-Elites, MOME, single-objective (μ+λ) EA, and simulated annealing) for molecular design using SMILES encoding and quantum-chemical property evaluation.

Result: NSGA-II consistently earns high scores across all objectives, producing high-quality molecules, while MOME better explores chemical space with higher global hypervolume and MOQD scores.

Conclusion: Different evolutionary algorithms have complementary strengths for NLO molecular design, with NSGA-II excelling at quality and MOME at diversity, collectively producing many promising molecules.

Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are essential for many photonic, telecommunication, and laser technologies, yet discovering better NLO molecules is computationally challenging due to the vast chemical space and competing objectives. We compare evolutionary algorithms for molecular design, targeting four objectives: maximizing the ratio of first-to-second hyperpolarizability $(β/γ)$, optimizing HOMO-LUMO gap and linear polarizability to target ranges, and minimizing energy per atom. We encode molecules as SMILES strings and evaluate their properties using quantum-chemical calculations. We compare NSGA-II, MAP-Elites, MOME, a single-objective $(μ+λ)$ evolutionary algorithm, and simulated annealing. Quality diversity methods maintain archives across a measure space defined by atom and bond count, enabling the discovery of structurally diverse molecules. Our results demonstrate that NSGA-II consistently earns high scores in every objective, leading to high-quality molecules, but MOME does a better job exploring a wide range of possibilities, resulting in higher global hypervolume and MOQD scores. However, each method has strengths and weaknesses, and produced many promising molecules.

TL;DR: A data-driven framework extracts effective optical constants for micron-scale photochromic hybrid films from minimal experimental measurements, enabling accurate optical modulation prediction without computationally expensive simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rational design of micron-scale photochromic hybrid films is constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. These materials have non-uniform particle distributions in polymer matrices, making conventional electromagnetic simulations computationally expensive and inaccurate due to discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions.

Method: Introduced a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. The dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states.

Result: Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, determined wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range.

Conclusion: The methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials, enabling rational design of photochromic devices for smart windows, adaptive optics, and reconfigurable photonic applications.

Abstract: Photochromic materials enable dynamic optical modulation through reversible transitions between distinct absorption states, with broad potential for smart windows, adaptive optics, and reconfigurable photonic devices. Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range. Our methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PIC methods need extensions to include macroscopic effects like shearing, expansion, and particle escape in collisionless plasma simulations, which are common in astrophysical environments but not handled by basic PIC algorithms.

Method: The paper reviews and improves three specialized algorithms: shearing-box for plasmas under shearing, expanding-box for expanding plasmas, and leaky-box for particle escape from confined accelerator regions. It provides numerical details for solving Maxwell's equations and particle equations of motion, and introduces generalized Boris-like particle pushers to handle extra forces.

Result: The work provides comprehensive implementation details and improved algorithms for incorporating shearing, expansion, and escape effects into PIC simulations, serving as a reference for researchers implementing these specialized methods.

Conclusion: This paper serves as a comprehensive reference guide for implementing shearing-box, expanding-box, and leaky-box algorithms in PIC simulations, addressing important limitations of standard PIC methods for astrophysical plasma modeling.

Abstract: Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods have achieved widespread recognition as simple and flexible approaches to model collisionless plasma physics in fully kinetic simulations of astrophysical environments. However, in many situations the standard PIC algorithm must be extended to include macroscopic effects in microscale simulations. For plasmas subjected to shearing or expansion, shearing-box and expanding-box methods can be incorporated into PIC to account for these global effects. For plasmas subjected to local acceleration in confined regions of space, a leaky-box method can allow closed-box PIC simulations to account for particle escape from the accelerator region. In this work, we review and improve methods to include shearing, expansion, and escape in PIC simulations. We provide the numerical details of how Maxwell's equations and the particle equations of motion are solved in each case, and introduce generalized Boris-like particle pushers to solve the momentum equation in the presence of extra forces. This work is intended to serve as a comprehensive reference for the implementation of shearing-box, expanding-box, and leaky-box algorithms in PIC.

TL;DR: First experimental determination of self-modulation instability saturation length in plasma wakefield acceleration, showing it decreases with plasma density and initial field amplitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-modulation instability is crucial for plasma wakefield accelerators using long particle bunches (like AWAKE) or long laser pulses, but the saturation length where wakefields reach maximum amplitude wasn't experimentally determined before.

Method: Experimental and numerical study varying plasma length and measuring transverse bunch radius to determine saturation length of self-modulation instability.

Result: Saturation length decreases with increasing plasma density and initial field amplitude (e.g., when seeding the instability).

Conclusion: Saturation length is a fundamental parameter for understanding self-modulation instability and designing plasma wakefield accelerators driven by long bunches or laser pulses.

Abstract: The self-modulation (SM) instability transforms a long charged particle bunch traveling in plasma into a train of microbunches that resonantly drives large-amplitude wakefields. We present the first determination of the saturation length of SM using experimental and numerical results. The saturation length is the distance over which wakefields reach their maximum amplitude along the plasma. By varying the plasma length and measuring the radius of the transverse distribution of the bunch, we find that the saturation length of SM decreases with plasma density and initial field amplitude, e.g., when seeding. The saturation length is a fundamental parameter of the instability, and these results are key for understanding SM and designing plasma wakefield accelerators driven by long bunches, such as AWAKE, or by long laser pulses for radiation production.

TL;DR: The paper develops a reduced model for wave-wave interactions in incompressible Hall MHD, showing that special resonant interactions produce amplitude-dependent nonlinear frequency shifts that modify linear dispersion relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how turbulence in magnetized plasma changes when Hall effects are added to MHD, making waves dispersive and altering nonlinear interactions, leading to different turbulent states.

Method: Developed a reduced model for wave-wave interactions in incompressible Hall MHD, focusing on processes that cause phase-coherent modifications to linear dispersion of waves.

Result: Special interactions provide amplitude-dependent contributions to linear dispersion relations, yielding nonlinear frequency shifts. Resonance-driven frequency shifts are dominant and add damping/growth to linear dispersion.

Conclusion: The damping/growth rates represent nonlinear timescales for energy redistribution and can be used with concepts like "critical balance" to estimate energy spectral content in Hall MHD turbulence.

Abstract: Turbulence in the magnetized plasma is well understood to be the consequence of wave interactions. When the Hall effect is added to the minimum magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the MHD waves become dispersive and different nonlinear interactions are expected. The emergent turbulent state will thus be expected to be different. For incompressible Hall MHD we develop a reduced model for wave-wave interactions concentrating on those processes that will lead to phase coherent modifications to the linear dispersion of a given wave. We show that these special interactions provide an amplitude-dependent contribution to the linear dispersion relation, which yields nonlinear frequency shifts. The resonance-driven frequency shifts are dominant and add damping or growth to the linear dispersion. The damping/growth rates represent the nonlinear time scales for energy redistribution and can be used in conjunction with a conjecture like the "critical balance" to estimate the energy spectral content.

TL;DR: PLANCK is a deep reinforcement learning framework using hypergraph neural networks to solve p-spin glass models and NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems with strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: p-spin glasses with frustrated many-body interactions (p>2) are NP-hard problems that are computationally prohibitive for large instances. Solving them is fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, topological phases, and many hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there's still no efficient scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models.

Method: PLANCK uses physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning built on hypergraph neural networks. It directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. The framework is trained exclusively on small synthetic instances.

Result: PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Without modification, it achieves near-optimal solutions for NP-hard problems including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut.

Conclusion: PLANCK provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm bridging statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design advances tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems and opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges.

Abstract: p-spin glasses, characterized by frustrated many-body interactions beyond the conventional pairwise case (p>2), are prototypical disordered systems whose ground-state search is NP-hard and computationally prohibitive for large instances. Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning.

Method: Hybrid approach combining homogenization-based relaxation for interior material distribution with shape optimization. Numerical method integrates homogenization and shape optimization: domain boundary evolved via level set method driven by shape derivative, interior material distribution updated via optimality criteria algorithm.

Result: Existence of generalized solutions established through the hybrid relaxation framework. The proposed numerical method successfully demonstrates simultaneous shape and material optimization on representative examples.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively addresses combined shape and material optimization problems for multi-state diffusion equations, providing both theoretical existence results and practical numerical implementation through integration of homogenization relaxation and level set methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses optimal design problems governed by multi-state stationary diffusion equations, aiming at the simultaneous optimization of the domain shape and the distribution of two isotropic materials in prescribed proportions. Existence of generalized solutions is established via a hybrid approach combining homogenization-based relaxation in the interior with suitable restrictions on admissible domains.
  Based on this framework, we propose a numerical method that integrates homogenization and shape optimization. The domain boundary is evolved using a level set method driven by the shape derivative, while the interior material distribution is updated via an optimality criteria algorithm. The approach is demonstrated on a representative example.

TL;DR: Nonreciprocal interactions in plasma-confined particle clusters create parametric coupling between vertical and horizontal oscillations, driving explosive growth and intermittent melting transitions between ordered and gas-like states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how nonreciprocal interactions (which violate Newton's 3rd law) can drive intermittency in complex systems, specifically examining how field-mediated interactions between particles can transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states.

Method: Three-dimensional particle tracking experiments on charged micron-sized particles confined in a plasma sheath, combined with simulations to analyze how nonreciprocal interactions amplify parametric coupling between vertical oscillations (induced by plasma fluctuations) and horizontal modes.

Result: Nonreciprocal interactions strongly amplify parametric coupling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives explosive growth of both horizontal and vertical modes, triggering abrupt melting transitions from ordered clusters to ergodic gas-like states, and causing intermittent switching between states over long time scales.

Conclusion: Nonreciprocal interactions serve as a key mechanism through which strongly coupled finite systems transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states, providing a new understanding of intermittency driven by field-mediated interactions rather than stochastic noise or external forcing.

Abstract: Complex systems out of equilibrium often experience intermittent oscillations between quiescent and highly dynamic states. The type of intermittency depends on how energy is pumped into the system, and how it is dissipated. While intermittency is usually driven by stochastic noise or external forcing, energy can also be sourced from field-mediated interactions between particles, which are often nonreciprocal and effectively violate Newton's 3rd law. Here we demonstrate how nonreciprocal interactions produce intermittency in clusters of charged micron-sized particles confined in a plasma sheath. Through three-dimensional particle tracking, we observe that vertical oscillations, induced by fluctuations of the plasma environment, can be parametrically coupled to the horizontal modes. Experiments and simulations show that nonreciprocal interactions strongly amplify this parametric coupling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives explosive growth of both the horizontal and vertical modes. This mechanism triggers abrupt melting transitions from an ordered cluster to an ergodic gas-like state, and leads to intermittent switching between states over long time scales. Overall, our work identifies nonreciprocal interactions as a key mechanism through which strongly coupled finite systems transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states.

### [45] [Combined dynamic-kinematic validation of droplet-wall impact modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16420)
*Dmitry Zharikov,Maxim Piskunov,Dmitry Kolomenskiy*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper shows that using only maximum spreading diameter for droplet impact validation is insufficient, and proposes a combined dynamic contact angle model that improves predictions of both spreading and receding dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many studies validate droplet wall impact using only maximum spreading diameter, but this single metric cannot ensure correct droplet dynamics. There's a need for more comprehensive validation combining geometric and kinematic metrics.

Method: Developed a combined dynamic contact angle model merging geometric accuracy of generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law with kinematic consistency of Hoffman function-based approach. Simulated water-glycerol droplet impact on sapphire glass at Weber numbers 20-250. Processed simulated radial velocity fields in Python using SciPy and compared with Particle Image Velocimetry measurements.

Result: Hoffman function-based model captures main droplet kinematic trends and provides more consistent receding dynamics. Generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law matches maximum spreading diameter within 7% but shows median absolute error in radial velocity up to 3x higher during receding. Introduced (β_max, Ca_char) diagram to relate spreading characteristics to internal flow dynamics.

Conclusion: Validation should combine geometric and kinematic metrics, not just maximum spreading diameter. The combined model improves predictions of both spreading and receding dynamics. Contact-line geometry may potentially be used to estimate internal kinematics with sufficient data.

Abstract: Many numerical studies validate droplet wall impact using only maximum spreading diameter, yet this metric alone cannot ensure correct droplet dynamics. We present a combined dynamic contact angle (DCA) model that merges the geometric accuracy of the generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law with the kinematic consistency of a Hoffman function-based approach, improving predictions of droplet spreading and receding. We simulate water-glycerol droplet impact on sapphire glass at Weber numbers 20 -- 250 and assess both contact angle formulations. Simulated radial velocity fields are processed in Python using SciPy and compared with Particle Image Velocimetry measurements in the longitudinal section of the spreading droplet. The Hoffman function-based model captures the main droplet kinematic trends and provides more consistent receding dynamics. The generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law matches the maximum spreading diameter within 7%. However, during receding, it shows a median absolute error in radial velocity up to three times higher than that of the Hoffman function-based solution. Average radial velocity and spreading velocity can differ from experimental trends even when maximum spreading is reproduced. These findings support validation combining geometric and kinematic metrics and motivate the combined model for predicting spreading and receding. Using the maximum spreading factor $β_{max}$ as the ratio of the maximum spreading diameter over the initial droplet diameter and the characteristic capillary number $Ca_{char}$ defined from the mean internal horizontal velocity at 300 micrometer above the substrate, we introduce a $(β_{max},\,Ca_{char})$ diagram to relate spreading characteristics to internal flow dynamics. We hypothesize that, given sufficient data, the contact-line geometry may be used to estimate internal kinematics.

### [46] [A fluctuating lattice Boltzmann formulation based on orthogonal central moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16486)
*Alessandro De Rosis,Yang Zhou*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: A fluctuating lattice Boltzmann method using orthogonal central moments representation that satisfies fluctuation-dissipation theorem exactly at lattice level, ensuring exact equipartition of kinetic energy and enhanced numerical stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal fluctuations are crucial in mesoscopic fluid dynamics but must be incorporated into numerical schemes consistently with statistical mechanics. Existing fluctuating BGK formulations have stability limitations, especially near stability limits.

Method: Developed a fluctuating lattice Boltzmann formulation based on orthogonal central-moments representation. Stochastic forcing is introduced directly in central moments space and paired with mode-dependent relaxation. Constructed explicit schemes for D2Q9 and D3Q27 lattices, with extension to reduced-velocity discretization.

Result: The method satisfies fluctuation-dissipation theorem exactly at lattice level, guarantees exact equipartition of kinetic energy, preserves Galilean invariance, and maintains enhanced numerical stability. It remains stable even in over-relaxation regime near stability limits, unlike fluctuating BGK formulations.

Conclusion: Central-moments-based lattice Boltzmann methods provide a natural and robust framework for fluctuating hydrodynamics, where dissipation, noise, and kinetic mode structure are consistently aligned at the discrete level.

Abstract: Thermal fluctuations play a central role in fluid dynamics at mesoscopic scales and must be incorporated into numerical schemes in a manner consistent with statistical mechanics. In this work, we develop a fluctuating lattice Boltzmann formulation based on an orthogonal central-moments-based representation. Stochastic forcing is introduced directly in the space of central moments (CMs) and consistently paired with mode-dependent relaxation, yielding a discrete kinetic model that satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem exactly at the lattice level. Owing to the orthogonality of the basis, the equilibrium covariance matrix of the central moments is diagonal, and each non-conserved mode can be interpreted as an independent discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with variance fixed by equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting formulation guarantees exact equipartition of kinetic energy at equilibrium, preserves Galilean invariance, and retains the enhanced numerical stability characteristic of CMs-based collision operators. Explicit fluctuating schemes are constructed for the D2Q9 and D3Q27 lattices. The extension to reduced-velocity discretisation is discussed too. A comprehensive set of numerical tests verifies correct thermalisation, isotropy of equilibrium statistics, and the expected scaling of velocity fluctuations with thermal energy, density, and relaxation time. In contrast to fluctuating BGK formulations, the present method remains stable and well posed in the over-relaxation regime, including in the immediate vicinity of the stability limit. These results demonstrate that CMs-based lattice Boltzmann methods provide a natural and robust framework for fluctuating hydrodynamics, in which dissipation, noise, and kinetic mode structure are consistently aligned at the discrete level.

TL;DR: Numerical simulation of explosive welding collision between lead and steel plates using multifluid Godunov-type algorithm with VOF interface tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study one-dimensional explosive welding problem involving lead and steel plate collision, accounting for tensile stresses in metals and comparing with experimental data.

Method: Multifluid Godunov-type finite-volume algorithm based on mechanical-equilibrium Euler equations with pressure relaxation, using VOF method to track interface between immiscible phases (metal plates and air).

Result: Numerical model successfully captures tensile stresses as negative pressure regions, and computed unloading wave arrival time at plate interface matches experimental data and other simulation methods.

Conclusion: The developed computational approach effectively simulates explosive welding collisions and validates against experimental measurements, demonstrating capability to model complex wave interactions and material behavior.

Abstract: The present study is concerned with a one-dimensional problem in explosive welding that pertains to the collision of lead and steel plates. The metal plates and the surrounding air are represented as separate immiscible phases governed by independent equations of state. A multifluid Godunov-type (finite-volume) computational algorithm, based on the mechanical-equilibrium Euler equations and incorporating pressure relaxation, is used to numerically describe the evolution of the waves resulting from the collision. The position of the interface (contact discontinuity) between immiscible phases is tracked by means of the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. The numerical model allows one to account for the existence of tensile stresses in metal and registers them as regions of negative pressure. The computed arrival time of the unloading wave at the interface between the plates agrees with the experimental data and with simulation results obtained via different methods.

*Zoltan Nemeth*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper shows that observed electron cutoff energy reflects local magnetic trap potential, not the Sun's full electrostatic potential, which is deeper. Moving magnetic traps capture electrons, preventing their return and contributing to solar wind formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To re-evaluate the relationship between observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the Sun's global electrostatic potential, questioning whether local magnetic traps provide an alternative explanation for the electron deficit.

Method: First-principles calculations of electron dynamics moving outward against solar electrostatic potential while interacting with magnetic mirror traps formed by interplanetary magnetic field fluctuations. Derivation of mathematical expression for cutoff velocity.

Result: Observed cutoff energy characterizes only local potential drop within traps, not total depth of Sun's potential well. True potential is deeper, scaled by ratio of radial distance to trap size. Electrons captured by moving traps contribute to solar wind core population.

Conclusion: Sun's electrostatic potential is more significant in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted. Interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides new framework for understanding solar wind core electron origin and behavior.

Abstract: This paper re-evaluates the relationship between the observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the depth of the Sun's global electrostatic potential. It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons.

Main category: math-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study unconventional superconductivity with long-range interactions, which requires addressing the computational challenges of solving the nonlinear BCS equation with power-law singularities in momentum space.

Method: Uses a Galerkin method with B-splines for efficient numerical solution of the nonlinear convolution equation, incorporating Epstein zeta functions to handle long-range power-law interactions in momentum space.

Result: Presents numerical results for a nodal superconductor on a two-dimensional square lattice, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed numerical approach.

Conclusion: The developed method successfully addresses the computational challenges of solving the BCS equation with long-range interactions, providing an efficient numerical framework for studying unconventional superconductivity in lattice models.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the analytical properties and the efficient numerical solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equation for unconventional superconductivity incorporating long-range power-law electron-electron interactions within a tight-binding model on a $d$-dimensional lattice. It is a nonlinear convolution equation for the complex matrix-valued superconducting gap under symmetry constraints imposed by the fermionic anticommutation rules. The long-range interaction enters in momentum space in the form of the now efficiently computable Epstein zeta function, which exhibits a power-law singularity at zero momentum. This needs to be accounted when evaluating the convolution. After a brief overview of some of the equation's analytical properties, we discuss its efficient numerical solution using a Galerkin method with B-splines. We present numerical results for a nodal superconductor on a two-dimensional square lattice.

*Ruiliang Li*

TL;DR: The paper establishes rigorous mathematical foundations for black hole spectroscopy using quasinormal modes, providing explicit error bounds for parameter recovery from ringdown signals in Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous PDE-to-data interface for high-frequency black-hole spectroscopy, establishing mathematical foundations for parameter recovery from gravitational wave ringdown signals with explicit error bounds.

Method: Uses meromorphic/Fredholm framework for quasinormal modes, semiclassical equatorial labeling, microlocal equatorial localization, analytic pole selection, and develops deterministic frequency-extraction stability estimates based on time-shift invariance.

Result: Proves a quantitative two-mode dominance theorem showing ringdown signals are governed by single quasinormal exponentials with controlled errors, obtains explicit parameter bias bounds for recovery of black hole parameters (M,a,Λ), and establishes localized pseudospectral stability for the equatorial resolvent package.

Conclusion: The paper provides rigorous mathematical foundations for black hole spectroscopy with explicit conditioning mechanisms (start time, window length, shift step, detector nondegeneracy), enabling reliable parameter extraction from gravitational wave data with quantified error bounds.

Abstract: We study scalar waves on subextremal Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes in a compact slow-rotation regime and at a fixed overtone index. Working initially at a fixed cosmological constant $Λ>0$ and uniformly for $(M,a)$ in a compact slow-rotation set, using the meromorphic/Fredholm framework for quasinormal modes and a semiclassical equatorial labeling proved in a companion paper, we establish a quantitative two-mode dominance theorem in an equatorial high-frequency package: after exact azimuthal reduction, microlocal equatorial localization, and analytic pole selection by entire localization weights constructed from equatorial pseudopoles, the $k=\pm\ell$ sector signals are each governed by a single quasinormal exponential, up to an explicitly controlled tail and an $\mathcal O(\ell^{-\infty})$ contribution from all other poles. We then develop a fully deterministic frequency-extraction stability estimate based on time-shift invariance, and combine it with the two-mode dominance result and the companion paper's inverse stability theorem to obtain an explicit parameter bias bound for ringdown-based recovery of $(M,a)$. Finally, using the companion paper's three-parameter inverse theorem and a damping observable based on the scaled imaginary part of one equatorial mode, we propagate the same deterministic error chain to a local bias bound for recovery of $(M,a,Λ)$ on compact parameter sets with $|a|$ bounded away from $0$. As a further consequence, we obtain a localized pseudospectral stability statement for the equatorial resolvent package, quantifying how large microlocalized resolvent norms enforce proximity to the labeled equatorial poles. The resulting estimates clarify the conditioning mechanisms (start time, window length, shift step, and detector nondegeneracy) and provide a rigorous PDE-to-data interface for high-frequency black-hole spectroscopy.

*Chaitali Patil,Qianying Shi,Abhishek Kumar,Veera Sundararaghavan,John Allison*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Study examines tension twins in Mg-Y alloys under compression, finding Y addition suppresses common TT1 twins but promotes rare TT2 twins, with crystal plasticity modeling revealing CRSS ratio changes and local strain effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how yttrium (Y) addition affects tension twinning behavior in magnesium alloys during compression, particularly the orientation specificity, CRSS evolution, and local stress/strain fields at twin sites.

Method: Combined experimental characterization with crystal plasticity modeling using PRISMS-Plasticity finite element solver. Studied four binary Mg-Y alloys under compression, incorporating both TT1 and TT2 twin modes for statistical analysis of orientation-stress-twin relationships.

Result: In Mg-7wt.%Y, rare TT2-{112-1} tension twins observed alongside common TT1-{101-2} twins. Y addition suppresses TT1 formation while promoting TT2 activity. Identified new orientation group with high Schmid factor for <c+a> slip that exhibits TT1 twinning. Modeling shows Y decreases CRSS ratio of prismatic/pyramidal slip relative to TT1, while slip-to-twin CRSS ratio for TT2 increases. TT2 sites show higher local strain accumulation despite small volume fraction.

Conclusion: Yttrium addition differentially affects tension twin modes in Mg alloys, with CRSS ratio changes explaining twin activity shifts. TT2 twins, though minor in volume, create significant local strain concentrations that could influence recrystallization and twin nucleation. Findings provide insights for alloy design targeting specific mechanical behaviors.

Abstract: Twinning is a primary deformation mechanism in Mg alloys. This study focuses on tension twins during uniaxial compression of Mg-Y alloys, with three key aspects: the orientation specificity of twin grains, the relative evolution of CRSS with increasing Y content, and the local stress and strain evolution at twin sites. Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling were performed. In Mg-7wt.%Y, TT2-{112-1} tension twins were observed in addition to the common TT1-{101-2} twins. Increasing Y suppressed TT1 formation while promoting TT2 activity. A previously unreported group of crystallographic orientations with a higher global Schmid factor for <c+a> slip was identified, which exhibited TT1 twinning with increasing compression strain. To elucidate Y effects on twin activity and local mechanical fields, both TT1 and TT2 tension twin modes were incorporated into PRISMS-Plasticity, an open-source, finite element-based crystal plasticity solver. Four binary Mg-Y alloys were modeled under compression, and statistical analysis was conducted to correlate initial orientations, stress-strain distributions, and twin activities as functions of Y concentration. The plasticity analysis revealed that increasing Y decreases the CRSS ratio of prismatic and pyramidal slip relative to TT1 twinning, while the slip-to-twin CRSS ratio for TT2 increases, thereby serving as a potential indicator of differential twin activity with Y addition in Mg alloys. Additionally, despite their small volume fraction, TT2 twin sites were predicted higher local strain accumulation locally, relative to the representative volume element and TT1 twins, suggesting their potential influence on localized phenomena such as recrystallization or twin nucleation. These findings provide insight into local mechanical behavior in Mg alloys and support alloy design for advanced engineering applications.

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: The paper studies Calabi-Yau conjectures for complete minimal hypersurfaces in dimensions n≥3, proving unboundedness for embedded minimal disks with bounded curvature via chord-arc estimates, while constructing counterexamples to properness using gluing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the Calabi-Yau conjectures for complete minimal hypersurfaces in higher dimensions (n≥3), which ask whether such hypersurfaces must be unbounded and proper. This extends prior work by Colding-Minicozzi in dimension n=2.

Method: Two main approaches: (1) Proving a chord-arc estimate for embedded minimal disks with bounded curvature, showing intrinsic distance is controlled by a polynomial of extrinsic distance. (2) Using gluing techniques to construct complete, improperly embedded minimal hypersurfaces in ℝⁿ⁺¹ for all n≥3.

Result: (1) Established polynomial control of intrinsic distance by extrinsic distance for embedded minimal disks with bounded curvature. (2) Constructed explicit examples of complete, improperly embedded minimal hypersurfaces in ℝⁿ⁺¹ for every n≥3, showing the properness conjecture fails in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: The properness conjecture suggested by Colding-Minicozzi's work in dimension n=2 fails in higher dimensions n≥3, as demonstrated by the constructed counterexamples. However, the unboundedness question remains open, though progress was made with chord-arc estimates for embedded minimal disks with bounded curvature.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Calabi--Yau conjectures for complete minimal hypersurfaces $Σ^{n}\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ in dimensions $n\ge 3$. These conjectures ask whether a complete minimal hypersurface must be unbounded, and more strongly, whether it must be proper. For the unboundedness question, we prove a chord--arc estimate for an embedded minimal disk with bounded curvature, showing that intrinsic distance is controlled by a polynomial of the extrinsic distance. On the other hand, using gluing techniques, we construct a complete, improperly embedded minimal hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ for every $n\ge 3$. This example shows that the properness conjecture suggested by the deep work of Colding Minicozzi [CM08] in the case $n=2$ fails in higher dimensions.

TL;DR: Equivariant index formula for twisted Dirac operators on compact globally hyperbolic spacetimes with timelike boundary, using APS boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend equivariant index theory from Riemannian to Lorentzian settings, specifically for globally hyperbolic spacetimes with boundaries, to understand the relationship between index theory and spectral flow in Lorentzian geometry.

Method: Develop a formula for equivariant index of twisted Dirac operators on compact globally hyperbolic spacetimes with timelike boundary using APS boundary conditions. The proof uses a reduction technique from equivariant to non-equivariant regime to establish an equivariant version of the Lorentzian "index = spectral flow" formula.

Result: The equivariant index formula for a group element is an integral over the fixed point set of that element plus boundary terms, which is the same structure as in the Riemannian case.

Conclusion: Successfully extended equivariant index theory to Lorentzian globally hyperbolic spacetimes with boundaries, showing that the fundamental structure of the equivariant index formula persists from Riemannian to Lorentzian geometry.

Abstract: We develop a formula for the equivariant index of a twisted Dirac operator on a compact globally hyperbolic spacetime with timelike boundary on which a group acts isometrically, subject to APS boundary conditions. The formula is the same as in the Riemannian case: the equivariant index for a group element is an integral over the fixed point set of that element plus some boundary terms. The proof uses a surprisingly simple technique for reducing from the equivariant to the non-equivariant regime in order to show an equivariant version of the Lorentzian "index $=$ spectral flow" formula.
