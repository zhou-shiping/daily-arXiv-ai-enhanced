However, it remains unclear on which spatial scales primordial signatures can survive the nonlinear processes accompanying structure formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of PMFs during gravitational collapse and to determine the spatial scales on which primordial signatures can persist. We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the Jeans scale and the associated turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification and to assess which structures retain memory of primordial fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "Primordial magnetic fields can survive structure formation on certain scales, with turbulence during gravitational collapse triggering small-scale dynamo amplification below Jeans scale.", "motivation": "To understand which spatial scales retain primordial magnetic field signatures despite nonlinear structure formation processes, and to investigate PMF evolution during gravitational collapse.", "method": "High-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos with varying viscosity to probe different Reynolds-number regimes, studying coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.", "result": "At high Reynolds numbers, turbulence during collapse triggers small-scale dynamo that amplifies magnetic energy below Jeans scale and modifies magnetic energy spectrum.
