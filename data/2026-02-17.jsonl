On a bounded interval, the nonlocal operator $\\partial_x^{-1}$ is localized through an auxiliary variable $v$ satisfying $v_x=u$ together with an additional boundary constraint that ensures uniqueness. We employ a mixed first-order formulation to decompose the dispersive operator and to localize the nonlocal term, and we couple the resulting semi-discrete HDG scheme with a $θ$-time stepping method for $θ\\in [1/2,1]$. We prove $L^2$-stability for suitable stabilization parameters and derive an {\\it a priori} $L^2(Ω)$ error estimate for smooth solutions that explicitly accounts for the nonlinear convective flux.\n  Numerical examples illustrate the convergence properties and demonstrate the scheme's capability to handle smooth and non-smooth solutions, including solitary wave propagation and peaked solitary wave (peakon) propagation in the zero dispersive limit regime."}

Two-derivative Runge--Kutta schemes may offer enhanced stability and accuracy properties compared to classical one-derivative methods, making them attractive in a wide variety of problems. However, their computational cost can be significant, motivating the use of a mixed-precision paradigm that employs different floating-point precisions for different function evaluations to balance efficiency and accuracy. To ensure that the perturbations introduced by the low precision computations do not destroy the accuracy of the solution, we need to understand how these perturbation errors propagate. We extend the numerical analysis mixed precision framework previously developed for Runge--Kutta methods to characterize the propagation of the perturbation errors arising from mixed precision computations in explicit and implicit two-derivative Runge--Kutta methods. We use this framework for analyzing the order of the perturbation errors, and for designing new methods that are less sensitive to the effect of the low precision computations. Numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear representative PDEs, demonstrate that appropriately designed mixed-precision two-derivative Runge--Kutta methods achieve the predicted accuracy."}

Here, we introduce a stochastic cluster expansion framework for efficiently recovering the total correlation energy of large systems with near-DMRG accuracy, without the need to select an active space a priori. By combining correlation contributions from randomly sampled environment orbitals with an exactly treated subspace of interest, the method reproduces total energies for non-reacting and reactive systems while drastically reducing computational cost. The approach also provides a quantitative diagnostic for molecule-solvent correlation, guiding principled embedding decisions. This framework enables systematically improvable many-body calculations in extended systems, opening the door to high-accuracy studies of chemical processes in condensed phase environments."}

One time integration technique that is capable of preserving the positivity of quantities for every time step size is the Patankar-trick and its variants. However, in the context of the Euler equations of gas dynamics, we wonder whether the Patankar-trick should be applied to the density and total energy equations or only to one of them. In this work, we discuss one drawback of the schemes when blindly applied to every positive conserved variable and additionally point out how to overcome the issue by balancing the involved numerical fluxes correctly. To illustrate our findings, we investigate modified Patankar--Runge--Kutta (MPRK) schemes in the context of the compressible Euler equations with and without stiff source terms. We discover that it is beneficial to only apply the Patankar-trick in the density equation and to balance the remaining numerical fluxes consistently rather than applying the trick also to the energy equation. This leads also to the preservation of contact discontinuities. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate that the accuracy of the methods is maintained while the performance of our approach is superior to the traditional application of MPRK schemes."}

Turbulence governs energy cascade, plasma heating, magnetic reconnection, and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, thereby influencing both ICME evolution and geoeffectiveness. While previous event-based and statistical studies have examined ICME turbulence and its radial evolution in great detail, no significant measurements of ICME magnetic turbulence at a specific vantage point have been made using multiple observatories separated azimuthally. Here, we present the first multipoint analysis of MHD turbulence across ICME plasma regions, using four spacecraft at the Sun-Earth L1 point, separated by 80 RE along the dawn-dusk direction. Previous studies reveal that ICME shocks, sheaths, and magnetic clouds are highly non-uniform, with strong azimuthal variability. Using high-resolution magnetic field observations from ISRO's Aditya-L1, NASA's Wind and ACE, and NOAA's DSCOVR, we analyze turbulence associated with the 10th October 2024 solar storm, which triggered the second-strongest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 25. Our results reveal significant variability and differing turbulence maturity across small separations, supported by analysis of field-aligned and perpendicular magnetic field cascades, indicating strong anisotropies. Sheath turbulence is substantially modified by shock induced energy injection. Evidence of compressible turbulence and plasma energization at the flux rope interaction region indicates that internal processes, such as magnetic reconnection, strongly influence ICME plasma evolution, highlighting pronounced spatial variability in turbulence and plasma states observed by multiple L1 monitors near Earth and underscoring their potential role in space weather impacts."}

The performance of the estimators and limiters are studied on adaptively refined meshes for several two-dimensional test problems, including boundary layers, interior layers, and a nonlinear convection problem with solution-dependent transport.\n  The experiments assess accuracy, preservation of the discrete maximum principle, adaptive mesh behaviour, and computational efficiency. The results show that the interaction between stabilization and a posteriori error estimation depends strongly on mesh alignment and on the character of the convection field. In particular, for problems with moving or curved layers, the behaviour of the limiters differs significantly: strongly upwind-biased limiters provide the most accurate solutions, while smoother algebraic stabilizations lead to more efficient nonlinear iterations. The study also indicates that residual-based estimators remain reliable for both linear and nonlinear problems but may react to changes in limiter activation during adaptive refinement.\n  Overall, the numerical results clarify the practical behaviour of several widely used stabilization techniques within an adaptive framework and highlight aspects that are not yet fully explained by the current theory, particularly for nonlinear transport problems."}

Here, we present an end-to-end generative framework that couples the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a differentiable ray-tracing engine to democratize the synthesis of diffraction-limited optical prescriptions. By treating optical design as a semantic-to-physical translation task, the system autonomously interprets prompts ranging from high-level end-user requests to rigorous technical specifications. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across three distinct regimes: (1) finite-conjugate industrial metrology systems, where the model autonomously enforces application-specific constraints such as telecentricity to achieve diffraction-limited performance; (2) a suite of infrared objectives (NIR, SWIR, and LWIR), demonstrating the framework's ability to synthesize valid topologies and optical prescriptions for non-visible spectral bands, and (3) complex aspheric mobile lenses, where the system successfully navigates the high-dimensional optimization landscape to produce high-resolution designs suitable for modern sensors.

The predictive accuracy of machine-learning models was first evaluated for single-dopant Pt configurations, demonstrating that the selected structural and chemical descriptors reliably capture the key factors governing dopant stability.

The method exploits a fourth-order Hermite expansion of the equilibrium distribution on the D2Q9 lattice, allowing higher-order isotropy to be retained while selectively filtering spurious non-hydrodynamic contributions.

These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory."}

This work introduces a quantum algorithm for the Non-Uniform Quantum Fourier Transform (NUQFT) based on a low-rank factorization of the NUDFT matrix. The factorization is translated into an explicit quantum construction using block encodings, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Linear Combination of Unitaries framework, yielding an $ε$-accurate block encoding of the NUDFT matrix with controlled approximation error from both classical truncation and quantum implementation. Under standard oracle access assumptions for non-uniform sampling points, we derive explicit, non-asymptotic gate-level resource estimates. The resulting complexity scales polylogarithmically with target precision, quadratically with the number of qubits through the quantum Fourier transform, and logarithmically with a geometry-dependent conditioning parameter induced by the non-uniform grid. This establishes a concrete and resource-efficient quantum analogue of the NUDFT and provides a foundation for quantum algorithms on irregularly sampled data."}

By using the method of characteristics to predict the analytical properties of PDE solutions a priori (even in regions arbitrarily far from the training domain), we show how it is possible to construct rigorous extrapolatory bounds on the worst-case L^inf errors of shallow neural network approximations. Then, by decomposing PDE solutions into compositions of simpler functions, we show how it is possible to compose these shallow neural networks together to form deep architectures, based on ideas from compositional deep learning, in which the large L^inf errors in the approximations have been suppressed. The resulting framework, called BEACONS (Bounded-Error, Algebraically-COmposable Neural Solvers), comprises both an automatic code-generator for the neural solvers themselves, as well as a bespoke automated theorem-proving system for producing machine-checkable certificates of correctness. We apply the framework to a variety of linear and non-linear PDEs, including the linear advection and inviscid Burgers' equations, as well as the full compressible Euler equations, in both 1D and 2D, and illustrate how BEACONS architectures are able to extrapolate solutions far beyond the training data in a reliable and bounded way.

Our results contribute to the growing interaction between spectral theory and nonlocal analysis, in line with recent advances in the area."}

We assume that the flow satisfies the slip boundary condition on the walls of the duct, and the state of the flow is given at the inlet of the divergent duct. When the fluid is a polytropic ideal gas, the problem can be reduced to some interactions of rarefaction simple waves, and the existence of a global classical solution inside the divergent duct can be established using the method of characteristics. In this paper we assume that the fluid is a nonconvex Bethe-Zel'dovich-Thompson (BZT) fluid. This type of fluid may significantly differ from polytropic ideal gases. For instance, physically admissible rarefaction shocks can occur. Depending on the oncoming flow state and the flare angles of the divergent duct, thirteen distinct types of oblique wave interactions may occur, including oblique composite waves consisting of shocks and centered simple waves. This paper systematically studies these oblique wave interactions and constructs global, piecewise smooth, supersonic solutions within the divergent duct using characteristic decomposition and hodograph transformation methods.

We propose the same procedure after application via Fourier transforms, since differentiating in Fourier space is multiplication with the Fourier wavenumber under suitable decay. Our methods are fast and efficient. Our methods oftentimes achieve superior PINN versus numerical error in fewer training iterations, potentially pair well with few samples in collocation, and can on occasion break plateaus in low collocation settings.

In this paper, we show how it is possible to circumvent these limitations by constructing formally-verified neural network solvers for PDEs, with rigorous convergence, stability, and conservation properties, whose correctness can therefore be guaranteed even in extrapolatory regimes. By using the method of characteristics to predict the analytical properties of PDE solutions a priori (even in regions arbitrarily far from the training domain), we show how it is possible to construct rigorous extrapolatory bounds on the worst-case L^inf errors of shallow neural network approximations. Then, by decomposing PDE solutions into compositions of simpler functions, we show how it is possible to compose these shallow neural networks together to form deep architectures, based on ideas from compositional deep learning, in which the large L^inf errors in the approximations have been suppressed. The resulting framework, called BEACONS (Bounded-Error, Algebraically-COmposable Neural Solvers), comprises both an automatic code-generator for the neural solvers themselves, as well as a bespoke automated theorem-proving system for producing machine-checkable certificates of correctness. We apply the framework to a variety of linear and non-linear PDEs, including the linear advection and inviscid Burgers' equations, as well as the full compressible Euler equations, in both 1D and 2D, and illustrate how BEACONS architectures are able to extrapolate solutions far beyond the training data in a reliable and bounded way.
