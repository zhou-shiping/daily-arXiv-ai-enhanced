### [1] [The spectral fractional Laplacian with measure valued right hand sides: analysis and approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11423)
*Enrique Otarola,Abner J. Salgado*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analysis of fractional Laplace operator with singular forcing, weak formulation in 2D, optimal control for fractional diffusion, and finite element schemes with convergence results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the spectral definition of fractional Laplace operator with singular forcing, develop appropriate weak formulations in fractional Sobolev spaces, and apply to optimal control problems for fractional diffusion.

Method: Introduce weak formulation in 2D fractional Sobolev spaces; develop finite element scheme with continuous piecewise linear functions; propose practical diagonalization scheme with regularization.

Result: Prove well-posedness of weak formulation; analyze pointwise tracking optimal control; prove convergence in energy norm and derive L² error bounds for both FEM and diagonalization schemes.

Conclusion: Successfully developed theoretical framework and numerical methods for fractional Laplace problems with singular forcing, with applications to optimal control and practical computational schemes.

Abstract: We consider the spectral definition of the fractional Laplace operator and study a basic linear problem involving this operator and singular forcing. In two dimensions, we introduce an appropriate weak formulation in fractional Sobolev spaces and prove that it is well-posed. As an application of these results, we analyze a pointwise tracking optimal control problem for fractional diffusion. We also develop a finite element scheme for the linear problem using continuous, piecewise linear functions, prove a convergence result in energy norm, and derive an error bound in $L^2(Ω)$. Finally, we propose a practical scheme based on a diagonalization technique and derive an error bound in $L^2(Ω)$ using a regularization argument.

### [2] [Adapting the Lanczos algorithm to matrices with almost continuous spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11449)
*Jörn Zimmerling,Vladimir Druskin*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new method for approximating B^T(A+sI)^{-1}B using Kreĭn-Nudelman semi-infinite strings with quadratic terminator, replacing traditional Lanczos with continuous spectral representation for better wave propagation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Krylov methods focus on resolving individual eigenvalues of dense discretizations while ignoring the underlying continuous spectral measures of problems with unbounded domains, leading to inefficient computation of MIMO transfer functions for wave propagation problems.

Method: Formulates a quadratic terminator using Kreĭn-Nudelman semi-infinite strings with adaptive parameter selection to maximize relative energy outflow. Creates low-rank modification to block Lanczos matrix dependent on √s with O(n) additional cost.

Result: Demonstrates significant error reductions for large-scale self-adjoint PDE discretizations in unbounded domains, including 2D/3D Maxwell's equations in diffusive regimes. Particularly effective for computing state-space solutions for wave propagation.

Conclusion: The method qualitatively improves finite-difference approximations by replacing conventional Lanczos spectral decomposition with continuous Kreĭn-Nudelman spectrum representation, transforming standing-wave artifacts into outgoing propagating waves.

Abstract: We consider the approximation of $B^T (A+sI)^{-1} B$ where $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is large, symmetric positive definite, and has a dense spectrum, and $B\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$, $p\ll n$. Our target application is the computation of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output transfer functions arising from large-scale discretizations of problems with continuous spectral measures, such as linear time-invariant PDEs on unbounded domains. Traditional Krylov methods, such as Lanczos or conjugate gradients, focus on resolving individual eigenvalues of a dense discretization, while ignoring the underlying continuous spectral measure that these points approximate. We argue that it is more efficient to model the inherent branch cut of the original operator than to exhaustively resolve the artificial point spectrum induced by discretization. We place this problem in a framework, known in the physics literature as the square-root terminator. To overcome its limitations, we formulate a quadratic terminator using Kreĭn--Nudelman semi-infinite strings, with parameters chosen adaptively to maximize relative energy outflow.
  This approach results in a low-rank modification to the (block) Lanczos matrix, dependent on $\sqrt{s}$, with an additional $O(n)$ cost. We demonstrate significant error reductions for large-scale self-adjoint PDE discretizations in unbounded domains, including two- and three-dimensional Maxwell's equations in diffusive regimes. The method proves particularly advantageous in computing state-space solutions for wave propagation, specifically for 2D wave and 3D Maxwell's operators. Implicitly replacing the conventional Lanczos spectral decomposition with a representation in terms of the continuous Kreĭn--Nudelman spectrum, we obtain a qualitative improvement in finite-difference approximations, effectively transforming standing-wave artifacts into outgoing propagating waves.

### [3] [On the Block-Diagonalization and Multiplicative Equivalence of Quaternion $Z$-Block Circulant Matrices with their Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11493)
*Daochang Zhang,Yue Zhao,Jingqian Li,Dijana Mosic*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces block-diagonalization techniques for z-block circulant quaternion matrices, develops algorithms for computing inverses, establishes equivalence between QT-product of tensors and z-block circulant matrix products, and applies these to various tensor decompositions with applications in video rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper has two main motivations: 1) To investigate block-diagonalization of z-block circulant matrices and develop algorithms for computing their inverses, and 2) To establish the equivalence between QT-product of tensors and the product of corresponding z-block circulant matrices, enabling large-scale testing and scalability analysis of Tikhonov-regularized models.

Method: The authors develop the bcirc_z-inv algorithm for computing inverses of z-block circulant matrices, establish mathematical equivalence between QT-tensor products and z-block circulant matrix products, derive various tensor decompositions (QT-Polar, QT-PLU, QT-LU, QT-SVD) based on this relationship, and develop corresponding algorithms with large-scale testing and scalability analysis.

Result: The paper provides properties of quaternion z-block circulant matrices, obtains series of quaternion tensor decompositions under QT-product, develops corresponding algorithms with large-scale tests showing scalability, and demonstrates applications in video rotation where QT-Polar decomposition maintains stability, inter-frame consistency, and accurate color reproduction.

Conclusion: The developed framework successfully connects quaternion tensor operations with z-block circulant matrix algebra, provides efficient algorithms for large-scale computations, and demonstrates practical applications in video processing where the decompositions maintain important visual properties like stability and color accuracy.

Abstract: The motivation of this paper is twofold. First, we investigate the block-diagonalization of the $z$-block circulant matrix $\mathtt{bcirc_z}(\mathcal A)$, based on this block-diagonal structure, and develop the algorithm $\mathtt{bcirc_z}$-inv for computing the inverse of $\mathtt{bcirc_z}(\mathcal A)$. Second, we establish the equivalence between the QT-product of tensors and the product of the corresponding $z$-block circulant matrices. Based on this equivalence and in combination with the algorithm $\mathtt{bcirc_z}$-inv, large-scale tests and scalability analysis of the Tikhonov-regularized model are conducted.
  As a by-product of the analysis, some relevant and straightforward properties of the quaternion $z$-block circulant matrices are provided. As applications, a series of quaternion tensor decompositions under the QT-product and their corresponding $z$-block circulant matrices decompositions are obtained, including the QT-Polar decomposition, the QT-PLU decomposition, and the QT-LU decomposition. Meanwhile, the QT-SVD is rederived based on the relation between $\mathcal A$ and $\mathtt{bcirc_z}(\mathcal A)$. Furthermore, we develop corresponding algorithms and present several large-scale tests and scalability analysis. In addition, applications in video rotation are presented to evaluate several rotation strategies based on the QT-Polar decomposition, which shows the decomposition remains stable and inter-frame consistent while accurately maintaining color reproduction.

### [4] [On the convergence rates of generalized conditional gradient method for fully discretized Mean Field Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11640)
*Haruka Nakamura,Norikazu Saito*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analysis of convergence rates for generalized conditional gradient method applied to discretized Mean Field Games, providing unified error estimates for both discretization and iteration errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work established convergence rates at the continuous PDE level, but lacked rigorous analysis accounting for both time-space discretization and iteration errors simultaneously in MFG systems.

Method: Discretize MFG system using finite difference method, analyze fully discrete GCG scheme, establish discrete maximum principles, derive explicit error estimates under structural assumptions on Hamiltonian and coupling terms.

Result: Explicit error estimates quantifying both discretization and iteration errors, showing convergence rates depend on mesh sizes and iteration number with non-uniform behavior, with higher rates achievable under additional regularity assumptions.

Conclusion: Provides rigorous unified framework for analyzing fully discrete GCG method for MFG systems, with theoretical results confirmed by numerical experiments.

Abstract: We study convergence rates of the generalized conditional gradient (GCG) method applied to fully discretized Mean Field Games (MFG) systems. While explicit convergence rates of the GCG method have been established at the continuous PDE level, a rigorous analysis that simultaneously accounts for time-space discretization and iteration errors has been missing. In this work, we discretize the MFG system using finite difference method and analyze the resulting fully discrete GCG scheme. Under suitable structural assumptions on the Hamiltonian and coupling terms, we establish discrete maximum principles and derive explicit error estimates that quantify both discretization errors and iteration errors within a unified framework. Our estimates show how the convergence rates depend on the mesh sizes and the iteration number, and they reveal a non-uniform behavior with respect to the iteration. Moreover, we prove that higher convergence rates can be achieved under additional regularity assumptions on the solution. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the theoretical results and to confirm the predicted convergence behavior.

### [5] [Fast Evaluation of Truncated Neumann Series by Low-Product Radix Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11843)
*Piyush Sao*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper presents new radix kernels for truncated Neumann series evaluation that reduce computational cost compared to existing methods like repeated squaring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Truncated Neumann series are important for approximate matrix inversion and polynomial preconditioning, but evaluating them efficiently is challenging. Existing methods like repeated squaring use O(log k) matrix products, but further optimization requires higher-radix kernels that were not available beyond radix-5.

Method: The authors construct radix kernels for T_m(B)=I+B+...+B^{m-1} and develop faster series algorithms. They derive an exact 3-product kernel with rational coefficients for radix 9, and use numerical optimization to create a 4-product kernel for radix 15. They also introduce a residual-based radix-kernel framework to handle approximate kernels with spillover.

Result: The radix-9 kernel achieves 5 log_9 k = 1.58 log_2 k products, a 21% reduction from repeated squaring. The radix-15 kernel achieves 6/log_2 15 ≈ 1.54, the best known asymptotic rate. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted product-count savings and runtime improvements.

Conclusion: The paper presents significant advances in truncated Neumann series evaluation through novel radix kernel constructions, achieving better asymptotic rates than previous methods and introducing a flexible framework that accommodates both exact and approximate kernels.

Abstract: Truncated Neumann series $S_k(A)=I+A+\cdots+A^{k-1}$ are used in
  approximate matrix inversion and polynomial preconditioning. In dense
  settings, matrix-matrix products dominate the cost of evaluating $S_k$.
  Naive evaluation needs $k-1$ products, while splitting methods reduce this
  to $O(\log k)$. Repeated squaring, for example, uses $2\log_2 k$
  products, so further gains require higher-radix kernels that extend the
  series by $m$ terms per update. Beyond the known radix-5 kernel, explicit
  higher-radix constructions were not available, and the existence of exact
  rational kernels was unclear.
  We construct radix kernels for $T_m(B)=I+B+\cdots+B^{m-1}$ and use them to
  build faster series algorithms. For radix 9, we derive an exact 3-product
  kernel with rational coefficients, which is the first exact construction
  beyond radix 5. This kernel yields $5\log_9 k=1.58\log_2 k$ products, a
  21% reduction from repeated squaring. For radix 15, numerical optimization
  yields a 4-product kernel that matches the target through degree 14 but
  has nonzero spillover (extra terms) at degrees $\ge 15$. Because spillover
  breaks the standard telescoping update, we introduce a residual-based
  radix-kernel framework that accommodates approximate kernels and retains
  coefficient $(μ_m+2)/\log_2 m$. Within this framework, radix 15 attains
  $6/\log_2 15\approx 1.54$, the best known asymptotic rate. Numerical
  experiments support the predicted product-count savings and associated
  runtime trends.

Method: Uses integral formulation of differential equations governing chemical reactions, followed by automatic procedure to recover admissible mass-action mechanisms. Provides theoretical justification with analytical and numerical error bounds.

Conclusion: The framework advances the goal of fully automated, data-driven chemical mechanism discovery by providing a robust and accurate method for reconstructing chemical reaction networks.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework that allows for the full mechanistic reconstruction of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from concentration data. The framework utilizes an integral formulation of the differential equations governing the chemical reactions, followed by an automatic procedure to recover admissible mass-action mechanisms from the equations. We provide theoretical justification for the use of integral formulations using analytical and numerical error bounds. The integral formulation is demonstrated to offer superior robustness to noise and improved accuracy in both rate-law and graph recovery when compared to other commonly used formulations. Together, our developments advance the goal of fully automated, data-driven chemical mechanism discovery.

### [7] [Avoiding stabilization terms in virtual elements for eigenvalue problems: The Reduced Basis Virtual Element Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11870)
*Silvia Bertoluzza,Fabio Credali,Francesca Gardini*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new Reduced Basis Virtual Element Method (rbVEM) for solving Laplace eigenvalue problems that combines virtual element method with reduced basis technique to avoid stabilization terms while maintaining conforming discretization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for solving Laplace eigenvalue problems that avoids the need for stabilization terms while maintaining full conformity, addressing limitations of traditional virtual element methods.

Method: Combines virtual element method with reduced basis technique to obtain explicit representation of virtual (non-polynomial) contributions to discrete space, resulting in a fully conforming discretization without stabilization terms.

Result: Proves that rbVEM provides correct spectral approximation with optimal error estimates, supported by comprehensive numerical investigation.

Conclusion: rbVEM is an effective approach for Laplace eigenvalue problems that eliminates stabilization requirements while maintaining theoretical guarantees of accuracy and convergence.

Abstract: We present the novel Reduced Basis Virtual Element Method (rbVEM) for solving the Laplace eigenvalue problem. This approach is based on the virtual element method and exploits the reduced basis technique to obtain an explicit representation of the virtual (non-polynomial) contribution to the discrete space. rbVEM yields a fully conforming discretization of the considered problem, so that stabilization terms are avoided. We prove that rbVEM provides the correct spectral approximation with optimal error estimates. Theoretical results are supplemented by an exhaustive numerical investigation.

### [8] [Splitting Schemes for ODEs with Goal-Oriented Error Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11972)
*Erik Weyl,Andreas Bartel,Manuel Schaller*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Hybrid error estimator combining dynamic iteration error and discretization error for ODEs solved with finite elements, enabling adaptive mesh refinement and dynamic iteration stopping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to balance both dynamic iteration error (from splitting-based distributed simulation) and discretization error in quantities of interest for ODEs discretized by finite elements.

Method: Combines classical dynamic iteration error estimates with dual weighted residual method to evaluate both error types, enables adaptive time discretization with different variable discretizations.

Result: Developed hybrid error estimator used for mesh refinement and dynamic iteration stopping, implemented with efficient linear algebra solvers for complex problems.

Conclusion: Numerical experiments show adaptive approach compares favorably to uniform refinement, enabling flexible discretization matching both goal and solution requirements.

Abstract: We present a hybrid a-priori/a-posteriori goal oriented error estimator for a combination of dynamic iteration-based solution of ordinary differential equations discretized by finite elements. Our novel error estimator combines estimates from classical dynamic iteration methods, usually used to enable splitting-based distributed simulation, and from the dual weighted residual method to be able to evaluate and balance both, the dynamic iteration error and the discretization error in desired quantities of interest. The obtained error estimators are used to conduct refinements of the computational mesh and as a stopping criterion for the dynamic iteration. In particular, we allow for an adaptive and flexible discretization of the time domain, where variables can be discretized differently to match both goal and solution requirements, e.g. in view of multiple time scales. We endow the scheme with efficient solvers from numerical linear algebra to ensure its applicability to complex problems. Numerical experiments compare the adaptive approach to a uniform refinement.

### [9] [Lambda admissible subspaces of self adjoint matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11976)
*Francisco Arrieta Zuccalli,Pedro Massey*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces Λ-admissible subspaces for matrices with clustered eigenvalues, showing they have nice approximation properties and that iterative algorithms converge to them, with bounds on distances and condition numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When dealing with self-adjoint matrices that have clustered eigenvalues, traditional subspace methods face challenges. The paper aims to develop a theoretical framework for understanding and analyzing subspaces that work well in this clustered eigenvalue setting.

Method: Introduces the novel concept of Λ-admissible subspaces for self-adjoint matrices with clustered eigenvalues. Analyzes properties of low-rank approximations using these subspaces, proves convergence of iterative algorithms (Subspace Iteration, Krylov methods) to these subspaces, derives bounds on distances between Rayleigh-Ritz subspaces and Λ-admissible subspaces, and analyzes condition numbers of the subspace mapping.

Result: Shows that low-rank approximations using subspaces close to Λ-admissible subspaces have desirable properties. Proves iterative algorithms converge to Λ-admissible subspaces. Provides upper bounds for distances between Rayleigh-Ritz subspaces and Λ-admissible subspaces. Establishes upper bounds for condition numbers of the subspace mapping. Numerical examples demonstrate advantages in clustered eigenvalue settings.

Conclusion: Λ-admissible subspaces provide a powerful theoretical framework for analyzing and understanding subspace methods in clustered eigenvalue scenarios, with practical implications for iterative algorithms and error analysis in numerical linear algebra.

Abstract: Given a self-adjoint matrix $A$ and an index $h$ such that $λ_h(A)$ lies in a cluster of eigenvalues of $A$, we introduce the novel class of $Λ$-admissible subspaces of $A$ of dimension $h$. First, we show that the low-rank approximation of the form $P_{\mathcal{T}} A P_{\mathcal{T}}$, for a subspace $\mathcal{T}$ that is close to any $Λ$-admissible subspace of $A$, has nice properties. Then, we prove that some well-known iterative algorithms (such as the Subspace Iteration Method, or the Krylov subspace method) produce subspaces that become arbitrarily close to $Λ$-admissible subspaces. We obtain upper bounds for the distance between subspaces obtained by the Rayleigh-Ritz method applied to $A$ and the class of $Λ$-admissible subspaces. We also find upper bounds for the condition number of the (set-valued) map computing the class of $Λ$-admissible subspaces of $A$. Finally, we include numerical examples that show the advantage of considering this new class of subspaces in the clustered eigenvalue setting.

### [10] [Mesh-free numerical method for Dirichlet eigenpairs of the Laplacian with potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12008)
*Dragoş Manea*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A mesh-free method for approximating Dirichlet eigenpairs of -Δ+V on 2D domains with radial potentials, using basis functions computed on a containing ball and minimizing boundary residuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient numerical method for approximating eigenvalues of Schrödinger-type operators with radial potentials on arbitrary simply connected domains, overcoming the limitation of needing explicit basis functions like Bessel functions when V≠0.

Method: Extends Method of Particular Solutions to radial potentials by: 1) solving -Δu+Vu=λu on a containing ball for many λ values using polar coordinates and Fourier expansion, 2) solving resulting ODEs with 1D FEM to get basis functions, 3) approximating eigenvalues by minimizing boundary residuals of linear combinations on ∂Ω.

Result: The method successfully approximates Dirichlet eigenpairs for operators with radial potentials, is mesh-free, and highly memory-efficient compared to standard FEM approaches.

Conclusion: Proposed mesh-free method effectively computes eigenvalues for Schrödinger operators with radial potentials on arbitrary domains, overcoming the lack of explicit basis functions through numerical construction and boundary minimization.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the numerical approximation of the $L^2$ Dirichlet eigenpairs of the operator $-Δ+ V$ on a simply connected $C^2$ bounded domain $Ω\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ containing the origin, where $V$ is a radial potential.
  We propose a mesh-free method inspired by the Method of Particular Solutions for the Laplacian (i.e. $V=0$). Extending this approach to general $C^1$ radial potentials is challenging due to the lack of explicit basis functions analogous to Bessel functions. To overcome this difficulty, we consider the equation $-Δu + V u = λu$ on a ball containing $Ω$, without imposing boundary conditions, for a collection of values $λ$ forming a fine discretisation of the interval in which eigenvalues are sought. By rewriting the problem in polar coordinates and applying a Fourier expansion with respect to the angular variable, we obtain a decoupled system of ordinary differential equations. These equations are solved numerically using a one-dimensional Finite Element Method, yielding a family of basis functions that are solutions of the equation $-Δu + V u = λu$ on the ball and are independent of the domain $Ω$.
  Dirichlet eigenvalues of $-Δ+ V$ are then approximated by minimising the boundary values on $\partial Ω$ among linear combinations of the basis functions and identifying those values of $λ$ for which the computed minimum is sufficiently small. The proposed method is highly memory-efficient compared to the standard Finite Element approach.

### [11] [Low T-Phase Rank Approximation of Third Order Tensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12121)
*Taehyeong Kim,Hayoung Choi,Yimin Wei*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper studies low T-phase-rank approximation of sectorial third-order tensors under tensor T-product, introducing canonical T-phases and T-phase rank, with applications to MIMO linear time-invariant systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop tensor phase theory for third-order tensors, extending matrix phase concepts to the tensor domain, particularly for applications in MIMO linear time-invariant systems where phase information is crucial.

Method: Introduces canonical T-phases and T-phase rank for sectorial third-order tensors under tensor T-product. Uses tensor phase-majorization inequality for geometric mean obtained via block-circulant representation lifting. In positive-imaginary regime, derives exact optimal-value formula and explicit optimal half-phase truncation family.

Result: Establishes tensor counterparts of classical matrix phase inequalities and derives a tensor small phase theorem for MIMO linear time-invariant systems. Provides exact optimal-value formula and optimal half-phase truncation family in positive-imaginary regime.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends matrix phase theory to third-order tensors under T-product, providing theoretical foundations and practical tools for low T-phase-rank approximation with applications to control systems.

Abstract: We study low T-phase-rank approximation of sectorial third-order tensors $\mathscr{A}\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n\times p}$ under the tensor T-product. We introduce canonical T-phases and T-phase rank, and formulate the approximation task as minimizing a symmetric gauge of the canonical phase vector under a T-phase-rank constraint. Our main tool is a tensor phase-majorization inequality for the geometric mean, obtained by lifting the matrix inequality through the block-circulant representation. In the positive-imaginary regime, this yields an exact optimal-value formula and an explicit optimal half-phase truncation family. We further establish tensor counterparts of classical matrix phase inequalities and derive a tensor small phase theorem for MIMO linear time-invariant systems.

*Antonio Capella,Valentin Linse,Christof Melcher,Lauro Morales,Ramón G. Plaza*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves existence and linear stability of time-periodic oscillating 180-degree Néel walls in ferromagnetic thin films under weak periodic external magnetic fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study dynamic behavior of magnetic domain walls in ferromagnetic thin films, specifically investigating whether time-periodic oscillating Néel walls exist and remain stable when perturbed by periodic external magnetic fields, extending the understanding beyond static configurations.

Method: Uses the reduced model for in-plane magnetization by Capella, Melcher, and Otto. Proves existence of time-periodic solutions via perturbation of static Néel walls under weak T-periodic external fields. Analyzes linear stability through Floquet spectrum of monodromy map for the propagator generated by time-dependent linear operators.

Result: Existence of time-periodic oscillating 180-degree Néel walls is proved. Linear stability is established by showing the Floquet spectrum of the monodromy map is contained within the complex unit circle, leveraging stability properties of the static Néel wall.

Conclusion: Time-periodic oscillating Néel walls exist and are linearly stable under weak periodic external magnetic fields, demonstrating that coherent magnetic structures can maintain stability while undergoing periodic oscillations.

Abstract: This paper studies the existence, the structure and the spectral stability of time-periodic oscillating 180-degree Néel walls in ferromagnetic thin films. It is proved that time-periodic coherent structures do exist as solutions to the reduced model for the in-plane magnetization proposed by Capella, Melcher, and Otto (Nonlinearity 20 (2007), no. 11, 2519--2537) when a weak and $T$-periodic external magnetic field is applied in the direction of the easy axes of the film, perturbing in this fashion the well-known static 180-degree Néel wall. The linearization around this time-periodic Néel wall is constituted by a family of linear operators, parametrized by the time variable, which generates an evolution system of generators (or propagator) for the linear problem. Profiting from the stability of the static Néel wall, it is shown that the Floquet spectrum of the monodromy map for the propagator is contained in the complex unit circle, proving stability of the oscillating solution at least at a linear level.

*Xingyu Wang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation with Saint Venant-Kirchhoff potential analyzed using modulated energy method and weak convergence, avoiding complex spectral analysis and relaxing initial data assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study phase transitions in matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equations with Saint Venant-Kirchhoff potential, aiming to develop a more robust approach that avoids complex spectral analysis of linearized operators and relaxes restrictive assumptions on initial data.

Method: Employ modulated energy method combined with weak convergence techniques for nonlinear PDEs, avoiding spectrum analysis of linearized operators at quasi-minimal orbits and construction of asymptotic expansions.

Result: Successfully analyzes the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation with relaxed assumptions on admissible initial data exhibiting phase transitions along initial interfaces, and constructs weak solutions to limiting harmonic heat flow system with both minimal pair and Neumann-type boundary conditions across interfaces.

Conclusion: The modulated energy method with weak convergence provides an effective alternative to traditional approaches for studying matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equations, offering broader applicability and constructing solutions to related limiting systems with various boundary conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we study a matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation with a Saint Venant-Kirchhoff potential $F(\mathbf{A})=\frac{1}{4}\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}^\top-\mathbf{I}\|^2$. Our approach employs the modulated energy method together with weak convergence methods for nonlinear partial differential equations. This avoids the subtle spectrum analysis of the linearized operator at the so-called quasi-minimal orbits as well as the construction of asymptotic expansion. Moreover, it relaxes the assumption on the admissible initial data, which exhibits a phase transition along an initial interface. As a byproduct, we construct a weak solution to the limiting harmonic heat flow system with both minimal pair and Neumann-type boundary conditions across the interface.

Motivation: Extend the scalar theory of uniform a priori bounds to Hamiltonian elliptic systems, solving an open problem from previous literature (de Figueiredo et al., 2006).

Method: Blow-up analysis combined with Liouville-type theorems and integral estimates to establish uniform a priori estimates for solutions.

Result: Successfully established uniform a priori estimates for solutions of semilinear planar Hamiltonian elliptic systems with asymptotic critical nonlinearities, extending scalar theory to Hamiltonian case.

Conclusion: The approach provides new uniform a priori bounds for Hamiltonian systems, enabling proof of existence of positive solutions via Fixed Point Index theory, solving a previously open problem.

Abstract: We establish uniform a priori estimates for solutions of semilinear planar Hamiltonian elliptic systems in a ball with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We consider a broad class of coupled nonlinearities with asymptotic critical behaviour in the sense of Brezis--Merle. The approach we follow is based on a blow-up analysis combined with Liouville--type theorems and integral estimates. Our results extend the scalar theory of uniform a priori bounds to the Hamiltonian case, and solve an open problem in [de Figueiredo D.G., do Ó J.M., Ruf B., Adv. Nonlinear Stud. 6 (2006), no. 2]. We believe that this approach is new in this setting. As a consequence of our a priori estimates, we prove the existence of a positive solution by means of Fixed Point Index theory.

### [16] [Global Multiplicity and Comparison Principles for Singular Problems driven by Mixed Local-Nonlocal Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11889)
*R. Dhanya,Sarbani Pramanik*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies a singular elliptic problem with mixed local-nonlocal operators, establishing global multiplicity results with respect to parameter λ, identifying sharp existence thresholds, and developing analytical tools including a Hopf-type comparison principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze singular elliptic problems involving mixed local-nonlocal operators, which combine classical p-Laplacian with fractional q-Laplacian, particularly focusing on understanding existence, non-existence, and multiplicity regimes for such singular problems.

Method: Develops variational methods and analytical tools including a Hopf-type strong comparison principle adapted to the nonlinear setting, establishes uniform L∞-estimates, and proves Sobolev versus Hölder local minimizer results for the mixed operator problem.

Result: Establishes a global multiplicity result with respect to parameter λ, identifying a sharp threshold that separates existence, non-existence, and multiplicity regimes. This result is new for singular problems involving mixed local-nonlocal operators.

Conclusion: The paper provides comprehensive analysis of singular mixed local-nonlocal elliptic problems, developing novel analytical tools that have broader applicability to similar problems and establishing fundamental existence and multiplicity results.

Abstract: We study a singular elliptic problem driven by a mixed local-nonlocal operator of the form \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
  -Δ_p u + (-Δ_q)^s u &= \fracλ{u^δ} + u^r \text{ in } Ω\newline
  u > 0 \text{ in } Ω,\ u &= 0 \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus Ω
  \end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $p > sq$, $0<δ<1$ and $λ> 0$ is a parameter. The nonlinearity exhibits a singular power-type behavior near zero and displays at most a critical growth at infinity. We establish a global multiplicity result with respect to the parameter $λ$ by identifying a sharp threshold that separates existence, non-existence, and multiplicity regimes, a result that is new for singular problems involving mixed local-nonlocal operators. We also derive a Hopf-type strong comparison principle adapted to this nonlinear setting, which provides the main analytical tool for the global multiplicity result. Additionally, we investigate qualitative properties of solutions that are essential for the variational analysis, such as a uniform $L^{\infty}$-estimate and a Sobolev versus Hölder local minimizer result. The analytical tools developed herein are of independent mathematical interest, with their applicability extending over a broader class of mixed local-nonlocal problems.

*Ba Duc Duong,Manuel Friedrich*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Approximation scheme for quasi-static crack growth using eigendeformation approach converges to Griffith brittle fracture model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a variational approximation scheme for quasi-static crack growth that can handle the complex geometry of cracks and converges to the classical Griffith theory of brittle fracture.

Method: Use eigendeformation approach with energy functionals depending on small parameter ε, displacement field, and eigendeformation field approximating cracks. Impose irreversibility condition and incremental minimization scheme to define quasi-static evolution.

Result: As ε → 0, the eigendeformation-based evolutions converge to quasi-static crack evolution for Griffith brittle fracture energy, satisfying irreversibility, global stability, and energy balance conditions.

Conclusion: The eigendeformation approach provides a valid approximation scheme for quasi-static crack growth that recovers the classical Griffith theory in the limit, offering a mathematical framework for analyzing fracture evolution.

Abstract: We study an approximation scheme for a variational theory of quasi-static crack growth based on an eigendeformation approach. We consider a family of energy functionals depending on a small parameter $\varepsilon$ and on two fields, the displacement field and an eigendeformation field that approximates the crack in the material. By imposing a suitable irreversibility condition and adopting an incremental minimization scheme, we define a notion of quasi-static evolution for this model. We then show that, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, these evolutions converge to a quasi-static crack evolution for the Griffith energy of brittle fracture, characterized by irreversibility, global stability, and an energy balance.

*Elena Beretta,Elisa Francini,Dario Pierotti,Eva Sincich*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves uniqueness for anisotropic conductivity tensor γ in an inverse boundary value problem for cardiac electrophysiology, using NtD data from a nonlinear PDE model with known nonlinear coefficient α and ischemic region D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by pacing-guided ablation in cardiac electrophysiology, the research aims to detect non-uniform conductivity in cardiac tissue. Ischemic regions (areas with reduced blood flow) are modeled by subdomains with piecewise constant conductivity, and the goal is to determine conductivity from boundary measurements for medical applications.

Method: The authors study a stationary nonlinear PDE modeling transmembrane potential in cardiac tissue. They use a first-order linearization approach around a nontrivial pacing current to transform the nonlinear inverse problem into a linear one. This allows them to analyze uniqueness for the anisotropic conductivity tensor γ from Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) map data, assuming the nonlinear coefficient α and ischemic region D are known.

Result: The main result is a proof of uniqueness for the anisotropic conductivity tensor γ from the NtD map in this nonlinear setting. This addresses a gap in previous literature where uniqueness for anisotropic conductivities with NtD data in nonlinear models had not been analyzed.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes uniqueness results for anisotropic conductivity detection in cardiac electrophysiology using boundary measurements, providing theoretical foundation for pacing-guided ablation procedures. The linearization technique enables analysis of the nonlinear inverse problem, opening possibilities for practical medical applications.

Abstract: We study the inverse boundary value problem of detecting a non-uniform conductivity motivated by pacing-guided ablation in cardiac electrophysiology. At the stationary level, the transmembrane potential $u$ in a region \(Ω\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) of cardiac tissue satisfies \[ -\nabla\!\cdot(γ\nabla u)+αu^3=0 \quad \text{in }Ω,\qquad γ\nabla u\cdotν=g \quad \text{on }\partialΩ, \] where $γ$ is an anisotropic conductivity tensor and $α$ a nonlinear ionic response coefficient. The Neumann data $g$ represent pacing currents, and the boundary values $u|_{\partialΩ}$ correspond to invasive voltage measurements. Ischemic regions are modeled by a subdomain $D\subsetΩ$ where $γ$ is piecewise constant. We address the inverse problem of determining $γ$ from the Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) map, assuming that $α$ and $D$ are known. To our knowledge, uniqueness in the case of NtD data with anisotropic conductivities in this nonlinear setting has not been analyzed in previous work. Using a first-order linearization around a nontrivial pacing current, we prove uniqueness for $γ$.

### [19] [Improved Interior Gradient Estimates for the Mean Curvature Equation under Nonlinear Assumptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11991)
*Fanheng Xu*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes sharp interior gradient estimates for solutions to the mean curvature equation with nonlinear right-hand side f(∇u), under weakened regularity assumptions. The estimates depend on solution oscillation and apply to various nonlinear terms including those from elliptic regularization of inverse mean curvature flow and minimal surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop gradient estimates for the mean curvature equation with nonlinear right-hand side under minimal regularity assumptions, enabling applications to various geometric PDEs including inverse mean curvature flow, minimal surfaces, and other growth regimes.

Method: The authors work under weakened regularity assumption u∈C¹(B_R)∩C³({|∇u|>0}) and establish sharp gradient bounds that depend on the oscillation of the solution. The estimates are developed for a wide class of nonlinear terms f(∇u).

Result: Sharp interior gradient estimates are obtained that imply uniform ellipticity away from the critical set, allowing application of classical elliptic regularity theory. For solutions with at most linear growth, the results enable Moser's theory to establish affine linear rigidity of global solutions, leading directly to Liouville-type theorems.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified framework for gradient estimates in mean curvature-type equations with nonlinear right-hand sides, with applications to regularity theory and Liouville-type theorems for global solutions under linear growth conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate interior gradient estimates for solutions to the mean curvature equation $$ \dive \left( \frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1 + |\nabla u|^2}} \right) = f(\nabla u)$$ under various nonlinear assumptions on the right-hand side. Under the weakened initial assumption $u\in C^1(B_R) \cap C^3(\{|\nabla u|>0\})$, we establish sharp gradient bounds that depend on the oscillation of the solution. These estimates are applicable to a wide class of nonlinear terms, including the specific forms arising from the elliptic regularization of the inverse mean curvature flow ($f=\varepsilon\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}$ ), minimal surface equation ($f=0$) and several polynomial and logarithmic growth regimes. As applications, the gradient bounds imply uniform ellipticity of the equation away from the critical set,which allows one to apply classical elliptic regularity theory and obtain higher regularity of solutions in the noncritical region. Moreover, when the solution grows at most linearly, all cases of our results can be applied in Moser's theory to establish the affine linear rigidity of global solutions. This directly leads to the Liouville-type theorems for global solutions without requiring additional proofs.

### [20] [Inner regularity and Liouville theorems for stable solutions to the mean curvature equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12001)
*Fanheng Xu*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies stable solutions of the mean curvature equation with a nonlinearity f(u). It establishes local Morrey regularity estimates for ∇u with optimal exponents for n≤5, and proves Liouville-type theorems for global solutions under growth conditions, showing no nonconstant radial stable solutions exist in dimensions 2-6.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the regularity and global behavior of stable solutions to mean curvature equations, extending classical results from semilinear equations to this geometric setting, and establishing optimal regularity exponents and Liouville-type theorems.

Method: Analytical PDE techniques including Morrey space estimates, stability analysis, and geometric methods for mean curvature equations. The approach involves establishing local regularity estimates through careful analysis of the equation's structure and using growth conditions to prove global Liouville-type results.

Result: 1) Local: ∇u satisfies inner Morrey regularity M^{p_n} with optimal exponent p_n for n≤5. 2) Radial: symmetry center is at most a removable singularity. 3) Global: Liouville-type theorem under growth conditions, showing no nonconstant radial stable solutions exist in dimensions 2-6, extending Farina and Navarro's classical result.

Conclusion: The paper establishes new regularity exponents and Liouville theorems for stable solutions of mean curvature equations, revealing both similarities and differences with semilinear equations. The results highlight the geometric nature of the problem and provide optimal regularity in low dimensions while showing global rigidity for radial solutions.

Abstract: Let $f\in C^1(\mathbb{R})$. We study stable solutions $u$ of the mean curvature equation \[ \operatorname{div}\left( \frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}} \right) = -f(u) \qquad \text{in}\ Ω\subset \mathbb{R}^n. \] In the local setting we prove that $\nabla u$ satisfies inner Morrey regularity $M^{p_n}$, where \[ p_n := \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} n,\qquad & \text{if}\ 2\leq n\leq 5, \\ \frac{n}{n-4\sqrt{n-1}+4},\qquad & \text{if}\ n\geq 6, \end{array} \right. \] together with the estimate \[ \|\nabla u\|_{M^{p_n}(B_1)} \leq C \left( 1+\|\nabla u\|_{L^1(B_2)} \right). \] The exponent $p_n$ is optimal for $n\leq5$, as shown by an explicit one-dimensional example. For radial solutions we show that the symmetry center is at most a removable singularity.
  Globally, we establish Liouville-type theorem: any stable solution satisfying the growth condition \[ |\nabla u(x)| = \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} o(|x|^{-1}) \ & \text{as}\ |x|\rightarrow +\infty& \text{when}\ 2\leq n\leq 10, \\ o(|x|^{-n/2+\sqrt{n-1}+1}) \ & \text{as}\ |x|\rightarrow +\infty& \text{when}\ n\geq 11, \end{array} \right. \] must be constant. In particular, no nonconstant radial stable solution exists in dimensions \(2\leq n\leq6\), which highlights a global rigidity of stable radial solutions in low dimensions and extend the classical Liouville theorem of Farina and Navarro.
  Several exponents appearing in our results are new for mean curvature equations, showing both similarities and differences with the corresponding theorems for semilinear equations.

TL;DR: Local Lipschitz regularity of minimizers for non-autonomous integral functionals with (p,q)-growth and Sobolev coefficients in W^{1,φ} spaces, under optimal ratio condition q/p ≤ 1 + 1/n - 1/r.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish local Lipschitz regularity for minimizers of non-autonomous variational integrals with general (p,q)-growth conditions and Sobolev-type coefficients, extending previous results and covering limit cases.

Method: Unified approach using (p,q)-growth conditions with energy density F(x,ξ) belonging to Sobolev class W^{1,φ} where φ(t)=t^r log^α(e+t), r≥n, α≥0. The method works under the condition 1 ≤ q/p ≤ 1 + 1/n - 1/r.

Result: Proves local Lipschitz regularity of local minimizers for non-autonomous integral functionals, covering both standard and limit cases, and recovers results from previous works (EMM16 and CGHPdN20).

Conclusion: The paper establishes optimal regularity results for minimizers of non-autonomous functionals with (p,q)-growth and Sobolev coefficients, providing a unified framework that includes limit cases and generalizes previous findings.

Abstract: We establish the local Lipschitz regularity of the local minimizers of non autonomous integral funtionals of the form \[ \int_ΩF(x, Dz)\,dx, \] where $Ω$ is a bounded open set of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \ge 2$. The energy density $F(x,ξ)$ satisfies $(p,q)-$growth conditions with respect to the gradient variable and belongs to the Sobolev class $W^{1,φ}$, with $φ(t)=t^r\log^α(e+t),$ $r\ge n$, $α\ge 0$, as a function of the $x$ variable, under the condition $$ 1\le\frac{q}{p} \le 1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{r}. $$ We present a unified approach that covers the limit case $$ \frac{q}{p} = 1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{r} $$ and retrieves the results in \cite{EMM16} and in \cite{CGHPdN20}.

*Flavia Giannetti,Antonia Passarelli di Napoli,Christoph Scheven*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves local boundedness of solutions to degenerate parabolic equations with p,q-growth conditions and unbounded coefficients, establishing two main results: boundedness from above for subsolutions and existence of locally bounded variational solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend regularity theory for parabolic equations to cases with degenerate coefficients and p,q-growth conditions, where traditional boundedness results may fail due to the gap between p and q and unbounded coefficient functions.

Method: The authors study parabolic equations with structure conditions involving p,q-growth and possibly unbounded coefficients a^{-1} and b. They impose integrability conditions on these coefficients and an assumption on the gap between p and q. The analysis focuses on subsolutions in natural energy spaces and variational structures.

Result: Two main results: (1) Subsolutions in the natural energy space are locally bounded from above; (2) For parabolic equations with variational structure, these bounds guarantee the existence of locally bounded variational solutions.

Conclusion: The paper establishes local boundedness properties for solutions to degenerate parabolic equations with p,q-growth and unbounded coefficients, providing important regularity results under controlled gap conditions between p and q.

Abstract: We investigate the local boundedness of solutions $u:Ω_T\to\mathbb{R}$ to parabolic equations of the form \begin{equation*}
  \partial_tu-\mathrm{div}\,\mathcal{A}(x,t,Du)=0 \qquad\mbox{in }Ω_T=Ω\times(0,T) \end{equation*} that satisfy $p,q$-growth conditions and have degenerate coefficients. More precisely, we assume structure conditions of the type \begin{align*} |\mathcal{A}(x,t,ξ)|&\le b(x,t)(μ^2+|ξ|^2)^{\frac{q-1}{2}},\\ \langle \mathcal{A}(x,t,ξ),ξ\rangle&\ge a(x,t)(μ^2+|ξ|^2)^{\frac {p-2}{2}}|ξ|^2, \end{align*} for $2\le p\le q$ and $μ\in[0,1]$, where the functions $a^{-1}, b:Ω_T\to\mathbb{R}$ are possibly unbounded and only satisfy some integrability condition. Under a certain assumption on the gap between $p$ and $q$, we prove two main results. First, we show that subsolutions that are contained in the natural energy space are locally bounded from above. Second, for parabolic equations with a variational structure, we use these bounds to show the existence of locally bounded variational solutions.

*Manuel Cañizares,Pedro Caro,Ioannis Parissis,Thanasis Zacharopoulos*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves that for time-independent potentials, the initial-to-final-state evolution map uniquely determines the Hamiltonian -Δ+V, requiring only L¹-type decay at infinity and allowing Lq-type singularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the evolution map (initial state to final state at fixed time T) uniquely determines the Hamiltonian -Δ+V that generates the evolution, particularly for time-independent potentials with minimal decay assumptions.

Method: Refinement of the Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge resolvent estimate to replace classical Agmon-Hörmander estimates, avoiding complex geometrical optics solutions by exploiting the time-independent setting.

Result: Uniqueness holds for time-independent potentials V ∈ L¹(ℝⁿ)∩Lq(ℝⁿ), with q>1 if n=2 or q≥n/2 if n≥3, significantly improving previous results that required stronger decay assumptions.

Conclusion: The time-independent setting allows much weaker decay assumptions than the time-dependent case, demonstrating that uniqueness can be established with only L¹-type decay at infinity and Lq-type singularities.

Abstract: The Schrödinger equation in high dimensions describes the evolution of a quantum system. Assume that we are given the evolution map sending each initial state $f\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of the system to the corresponding final state at a fixed time $T$. The main question we address in this paper is whether this initial-to-final-state map uniquely determines the Hamiltonian $-Δ+V$ that generates the evolution. We restrict attention to time-independent potentials $V$ and show that uniqueness holds provided $V \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)\cap L^q(\mathbb{R}^n)$, with $q>1$ if $n=2$ or $q\geq n/2$ if $n\geq 3$. This should be compared with the results of Caro and Ruiz, who proved that in the time-dependent case, uniqueness holds under the stronger assumption that the potential exhibits super-exponential decay at infinity, for both bounded and unbounded potentials. This paper extends earlier work of the same authors, where uniqueness was obtained for bounded time-independent potentials with polynomial decay at infinity. Here we only require $L^1$-type decay at infinity and allow for $L^q$-type singularities. We reach this improvement by providing a refinement of the Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge resolvent estimate, which replaces the classical Agmon-Hörmander estimates used previously. Crucially, the time-independent setting allows us to avoid the use of complex geometrical optics solutions and thereby dispense with strong decay assumptions at infinity.

*Filone G. Longmou-Moffo,Mouhamadou Sy*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes a probabilistic global theory in H¹ for NLS with Moser-Trudinger nonlinearity on compact surfaces, addressing existence, uniqueness, and continuity for large data in supercritical regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work showed instabilities and lack of continuity in supercritical regimes, with only distributional non-unique probabilistic solutions available. The authors aim to build a unified probabilistic framework that provides existence, uniqueness, and continuity with respect to initial data in H¹.

Method: Uses Yudowich argument for uniqueness and continuity, probabilistic estimates via IID limit procedure. Key challenge is designing dissipation operator to balance continuity properties with large data support in reference measure.

Result: Establishes probabilistic global theory in H¹ with existence, uniqueness, and continuity. Shows modified energy can reach arbitrarily high values, suggesting constructed data set contains supercritical regimes.

Conclusion: Successfully builds single probabilistic framework overcoming previous limitations, handling both continuity requirements and large data support for NLS with Moser-Trudinger nonlinearity on compact surfaces.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a probabilistic global theory in $H^1$ for the NLS with a Moser-Trudinger nonlinearity posed on compact surfaces. This equation is known to be the two dimensional counterpart to the classical energy-critical Schrödinger equations \cite{CollianderIbrahimMajdoubMasmoudi2009}. The authors of \cite{CollianderIbrahimMajdoubMasmoudi2009} also identified a trichotomy around the criticality of the equation based on the size of the total energy. In particular, for supercritical regimes (large energy), the equation is known to exhibit instabilities : the (uniform) continuity of the flow fails to hold. Large data distributional non unique probabilistic solutions have been obtained in \cite{CasterasMonsaingeon2024}. The setting of \cite{CasterasMonsaingeon2024} does not handle the uniqueness issue for the $H^1$-data and therefore could not define a flow for this regularity. Our main focus here is to build a single probabilistic framework that provides both existence, uniqueness, and continuity with respect to the initial data in $H^1$. Our uniqueness and continuity are based on the so-called Yudowich argument \cite{Judovic1963}, and the probabilistic estimates are derived through the IID limit procedure \cite{Sy2019}. Beyond the difficulties related to the borderline nature of the context, the major challenge resides in the need to satisfy two features that tend to play against each other : obtaining both continuity property of the flow and large data in the support of the reference measure. This made the design of the dissipation operator inherent in the method, as well as the analysis of the resulting quantities, particularly difficult. Regarding the supercritical regime, we show that a modified energy, with regularity similar to the original total energy, admits values as high as desired, suggesting that the constructed set of data contains supercritical ones.

*Tobias Black,Michael Winkler*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves global existence and exponential stabilization for a nonlinear thermoacoustic system modeling heat generation in Zener materials, under a specific parameter condition that matches the stability regime of the Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by modeling heat generation in Zener type materials subjected to stress from acoustic waves. The system couples mechanical wave propagation with temperature evolution through nonlinear thermoacoustic effects.

Method: The authors analyze a one-dimensional system of PDEs consisting of a third-order wave equation coupled with a heat equation. They use a strong solvability framework and impose smallness conditions on initial data derivatives. The key assumption is the parameter condition αb > τ, which ensures stability.

Result: For all Θ₊ > 0, there exists ν > 0 such that when initial temperature is bounded by Θ₊ and initial derivatives are sufficiently small (less than ν), the Neumann initial-boundary value problem admits a unique global solution. The solution exhibits exponential stabilization for both mechanical and thermal components.

Conclusion: The parameter condition αb > τ provides a full stability regime for the nonlinear thermoacoustic system, coinciding with the known stability range for the corresponding Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation, despite strong nonlinear coupling to temperature.

Abstract: This manuscript is concerned with the one-dimensional system \[
  \begin{array}{l}
  τu_{ttt} + αu_{tt} = b \big(γ(Θ) u_{xt}\big)_x + \big( γ(Θ) u_x\big)_x, \\[1mm]
  Θ_t = D Θ_{xx} + bγ(Θ) u_{xt}^2,
  \end{array} \] which is connected to the simplified modeling of heat generation in Zener type materials subject to stress from acoustic waves. Under the assumption that the coefficients $τ>0, b>0$ and $α\geq0$ satisfy \begin{align}\tag{$\star$}
  αb >τ, \end{align} it is shown that for all $Θ_\star>0$ one can find $ν=ν(D,τ,α,b,Θ_\star,γ)>0$ such that an associated Neumann type initial-boundary value problem with Neumann data admits a unique time-global solution in a suitable framework of strong solvability whenever the initial temperature distribution fulfills $$\|Θ_0\|_{L^\infty(Ω)}\leq Θ_\star$$ and the derivatives of the initial data are sufficiently small in the sense of satisfying $$\int_Ωu_{0xx}^2 + \int_Ω(u_{0t})_{xx}^2 + \int_Ω(u_{0tt})_x^2 < ν\quad\text{and}\quad
  \|Θ_{0x}\|_{L^\infty(Ω)}
  + \|Θ_{0xx}\|_{L^\infty(Ω)}
  < ν.$$ The constructed solution moreover features an exponential stabilization property for both components.
  In particular, the parameter range described by ($\star$) coincides with the full stability regime known for the corresponding Moore--Gibson--Thompson equation despite the fairly strong nonlinear coupling to the temperature variable.

TL;DR: A stochastic framework for low-population dynamics in circulating-fuel reactors that captures delayed-neutron precursor transport without delay terms, using both analog Monte Carlo and SDE approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a minimal yet representative model for low-population kinetics in circulating-fuel reactors (CFRs) that properly accounts for delayed-neutron precursor transport, which is important for accurate transient analysis and safety assessments.

Method: Starting from a modified point-kinetics model with two perfectly-mixed volumes, the authors derive equivalent discrete-event dynamics and an Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. They implement two solvers: an analog Monte Carlo (AMC) engine and a semi-implicit Milstein SDE solver.

Result: Transient benchmarks show perfect agreement of AMC/SDE means with deterministic solutions, but reveal that the SDE approach underestimates DNP variances in selected regimes, potentially due to neglect of DNP noise. Reactivity loss due to precursor drift estimator is shown to be negatively biased.

Conclusion: The developed framework provides a minimal yet representative model for CFR low-population kinetics. Future work will re-derive and test SDE noise terms and apply the framework to selected transient applications such as start-up analyses of CFRs.

Result: Achieved highly accurate results for deuteron with relative error between PINN-predicted binding energy and numerical benchmark of order 10^-6. Successfully handled realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions including those with strong high-momentum correlations.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates PINNs can successfully solve complex nuclear physics problems with high accuracy, paving the way for applying PINNs to more complex atomic nuclei beyond the deuteron benchmark.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques have proven to be effective in addressing the structure of atomic nuclei. Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a promising machine learning technique suitable for solving integro-differential problems such as the many-body Schrödinger problem. So far, there has been no demonstration of extracting nuclear eigenstates using such method. Here, we tackle realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction in momentum space, including models with strong high-momentum correlations, and demonstrate highly accurate results for the deuteron. We further provide additional benchmarks in coordinate space. We introduce an expression for the variational energy that enters the loss function, which can be evaluated efficiently within the PINNs framework. Results are in excellent agreement with proven numerical methods, with a relative error between the value of the predicted binding energy by the PINN and the numerical benchmark of the order of $10^{-6}$. Our approach paves the way for the exploitation of PINNs to solve more complex atomic nuclei.

*Ruofan Wang,Mohammed Al-Kobaisi*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: LIETS algorithm accelerates QSGS microstructure generation by tracking active growth fronts instead of full grids, achieving 24s for 400^3 domains on consumer GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical QSGS algorithms are computationally expensive for large 3D grids in digital rock physics, needing more efficient high-resolution microstructure generation methods.

Method: List-indexed explicit time-stepping (LIETS) formulation restricts stochastic growth to active fronts, implemented with Python/NumPy (CPU) and CuPy (GPU), with seed-spacing control via diamond dilation and volume-fraction-dependent directional growth probability.

Result: LIETS reduces generation time from tens of minutes (serial CPU) to ~24s on RTX 4060 for 400^3 domains (2.7x10^7 nodes/s throughput). Reproduces pore/grain size distributions and permeability-porosity trends consistent with experimental data and Fast-QSGS.

Conclusion: LIETS enables efficient high-resolution microstructure generation for digital rock physics, maintaining accuracy while dramatically improving computational performance on consumer hardware.

Abstract: Efficient generation of high-resolution synthetic microstructures is essential in digital rock physics, yet classical Quartet Structure Generation Set (QSGS) algorithms become prohibitively expensive on large three-dimensional grids. We develop a list-indexed explicit time-stepping (LIETS) formulation of QSGS that restricts stochastic growth operations to an explicit active front instead of the entire voxel grid. The method is implemented in Python using NumPy on CPUs and CuPy on GPUs, and incorporates seed-spacing control via diamond dilation together with a volume-fraction-dependent directional growth probability. For a 400^3 domain, LIETS reduces generation time from tens of minutes for a serial CPU implementation and several minutes for vectorized CPU and GPU QSGS to about 24 s on a consumer-grade RTX 4060, achieving peak throughputs up to 2.7x10^7 nodes/s. A Fontainebleau sandstone benchmark at 500^3 resolution shows that LIETS reproduces the dependence of pore and grain size distributions on seed spacing (optimal s=30 voxels) and yields permeability-porosity trends within the experimental envelope and consistent with previously published Fast-QSGS results.

### [30] [Investigation of Toroidal Rotation Effects on Spherical Torus Equilibria using the Fast Spectral Solver VEQ-R](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11422)
*Xingyu Li,Huasheng Xie,Lai Wei,Zhengxiong Wang*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: VEQ-R is a fast spectral solver for tokamak plasma equilibria with strong toroidal rotation, using Chebyshev expansion and matrix acceleration to achieve 5ms convergence while capturing complex geometric distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reduced models fail to adequately describe the complex geometric response of tokamak plasmas to strong toroidal rotation, especially in challenging sonic regimes (M ~ 1.0).

Method: Uses a 12-parameter shifted Chebyshev spectral expansion to resolve radial variations in shaping profiles, combined with a novel "Matrix-Kernel" acceleration technique that transforms the problem into pre-computed algebraic matrix operations.

Result: Achieves convergence in approximately 5 ms while maintaining exceptional geometric fidelity compared to high-resolution benchmarks. The solver captures rotation-induced flux compression that monotonically decreases the core safety factor q₀, pushing it dangerously close to unity.

Conclusion: VEQ-R provides an approximate yet robust solver that effectively captures structural deformation mechanisms in rotating tokamak plasmas, balancing speed and accuracy for practical applications.

Abstract: Standard reduced models often fail to adequately describe the complex geometric response of tokamak plasmas to strong toroidal rotation. In this work, we present VEQ-R, a computationally efficient spectral solver designed to calculate fixed-boundary equilibria with arbitrary toroidal flow. In contrast to computationally intensive grid-based codes, our model employs a 12-parameter shifted Chebyshev spectral expansion to explicitly resolve radial variations in high-order shaping profiles--such as dynamic elongation and triangularity. This capability allows the solver to accurately capture differential flux surface distortions (non-rigid effects) even in challenging sonic regimes ($M \sim 1.0$). By synergizing this compact variational formulation with a novel ``Matrix-Kernel'' acceleration technique, we transform the problem into pre-computed algebraic matrix operations. This approach achieves convergence in approximately 5 ms, maintaining exceptional geometric fidelity compared to high-resolution benchmarks while balancing speed and accuracy. Our analysis reveals that rotation-induced flux compression leads to a monotonic decrease in the core safety factor $q_0$, pushing it dangerously close to unity--a structural deformation mechanism effectively captured by this approximate yet robust solver.

TL;DR: DC plasma sputtering of carbonaceous Al2O3 microdots on FTO reduces reflectance for better light-trapping in solar cells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FTO's high reflectance limits light-trapping efficiency in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, requiring anti-reflective coatings.

Method: Simple DC plasma sputtering to deposit carbonaceous Al2O3 microdots on FTO under controlled Ar, O2, and Ar-O2 atmospheres, with Volmer-Weber growth producing discrete microdots.

Result: Ar-O2 coatings achieved lowest reflectance across visible range; dense uniform dots in Ar (~0.89 um radius), agglomerated structures in O2, intermediate morphologies in mixed atmospheres; gamma-Al2O3 formation with carbon incorporation confirmed.

Conclusion: Establishes link between sputtering parameters, surface morphology, and optical performance, offering scalable route to anti-reflective, light-trapping coatings for next-generation solar cells and optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is a key transparent conductive oxide for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, yet its high reflectance limits light-trapping efficiency. This work demonstrates a simple DC plasma sputtering approach to deposit carbonaceous Al2O3 microdots on FTO under controlled Ar, O2, and Ar-O2 atmospheres. For plasma discharge in the normal mode, with plasma density 10^-9 cm^-3 and temperature of 2 eV, Volmer-Weber growth produced discrete microdots whose size and distribution were tuned by gas composition: dense, uniform dots in Ar (approximately 0.89 um radius), agglomerated structures in O2, and intermediate morphologies in mixed atmospheres. Structural analysis confirmed gamma-Al2O3 formation with carbon incorporation, while SEM revealed morphology-driven optical behavior. UV-Vis measurements showed that Ar-O2 coatings achieved the lowest reflectance across the visible range, outperforming bare FTO and other conditions. These findings establish a clear link between sputtering parameters, surface morphology, and optical performance, offering a scalable route to anti-reflective, light-trapping coatings for next-generation solar cells and optoelectronic devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To go beyond just examining the final equilibrium state and instead investigate the detailed intermediate processes that occur as systems approach thermal equilibrium, providing a more complete understanding of how the Zeroth Law manifests dynamically.

Method: Classical molecular dynamics simulations of two- and three-region models using argon atoms, analyzing fluctuations, correlations, and temperature distributions during heat conduction between regions separated by heat-conducting walls.

Result: The study successfully captures the intermediate stages of thermal equilibration, showing how heat conduction influences the time to reach equilibrium and revealing detailed dynamics of temperature distributions and correlations between regions.

Conclusion: The work provides a detailed microscopic view of how systems evolve toward thermal equilibrium, offering insights into the dynamic processes underlying the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics through molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract: The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third one, then they are also in equilibrium with each other. This study explores not only the final state of thermal equilibrium between ideal gases separated by heat-conducting walls, but also the intermediate stages leading up to equilibrium, using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Two- and three-region models with argon atoms are analyzed. Fluctuations, correlations, and temperature distributions are observed, highlighting how heat conduction between regions influences the time to reach equilibrium. This work is distinguished by its detailed analysis of the intermediate stages that occur until the system reaches thermal equilibrium, in accordance with the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics.

*Sihui Zhong,Andrew Hillier,Iñigo Arregui*

TL;DR: 3D MHD simulations show nonlinear damping in coronal loop oscillations via Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence, with observational signatures preserved in synthetic EUV images but requiring higher resolution for full detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations in coronal loops are influenced by nonlinear processes like Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and turbulence, but comprehensive theory and observational confirmation remain limited.

Method: Used 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and forward-modelled EUV images to investigate observational signatures of nonlinear damping by KHI-induced turbulence in impulsively driven transverse loop oscillations.

Result: Simulations show time-varying frequency shifts and damping rates consistent with nonlinear turbulence theory, excitation of higher-order modes, slightly increased periods, and reduced amplitudes. Synthetic observations preserve these features but require higher spatial resolution. Hotter EUV channels show faster decay with smaller displacements and larger phase shifts. Bayesian fitting shows robust constraints on initial amplitude and period but degeneracy in damping parameters.

Conclusion: Results provide quantitative basis for identifying nonlinear damping and detecting KHI-driven turbulence in transverse loop oscillations, though additional observables are needed for reliable seismological inference of damping profiles.

Abstract: Large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations of coronal loops are strongly influenced by nonlinear processes, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and turbulence, though comprehensive theory and observational confirmation remain limited. Building on the recently developed theory on nonlinear damping by KHI-induced turbulence in impulsively driven transverse loop oscillations, we investigate its observational signatures using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and forward-modelled EUV images. The simulated oscillations exhibit time-varying frequency shifts and damping rates, which are broadly consistent with nonlinear turbulence-damping theory. Additionally, they exhibit excitation of higher-order modes, slightly increased periods relative to the linear kink period, and reduced displacement amplitudes. These features are generally preserved in synthetic observations, though resolving higher-order modes requires higher spatial resolution than currently available. For loops embedded in a hotter background, hotter channels (e.g., 193 Angstroms) are more sensitive to boundary dynamics, thus their oscillations decay faster with smaller displacements and larger phase shifts than those in cooler channels (e.g., 171 Angstroms). Comparisons of simulated and synthetic oscillations show close agreement at the early stage. At later times, synthetic oscillations exhibit smaller displacements and larger phase shifts, due to turbulence-induced asymmetry in the loop cross-section. Bayesian fitting shows that the initial oscillation amplitude and kink period are robustly constrained, whereas parameters controlling the damping profile are degenerate, indicating that additional observables would aid reliable seismological inference. These results provide a quantitative basis for identifying nonlinear damping and detecting KHI-driven turbulence in transverse loop oscillations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological wave phenomena in continuous media face fundamental challenges: unbounded spectra and absence of compact Brillouin zone obstruct conventional bulk-interface formulations. Need systematic framework beyond compact-band and idealized Hermitian settings.

Method: Develop unified phase-space framework for screened magnetized plasma using pseudo-Hermitian formulation with positive-definite metric. Enables generalized Schrödinger description and Weyl-symbol analysis of bulk generator. Introduces strip-gap Chern number associated with finite real-frequency strips of bulk spectrum.

Result: Bulk symbol hosts isolated band degeneracies acting as Berry-Chern monopoles, including higher-order spin-1 degeneracy with topological charge +2. Strip-gap Chern number governs spectral flow of interface modes induced by magnetic field variations. Net spectral flow across strip gap determined by enclosed monopole charge. Correspondence persists under collisional damping if finite strip gap remains and no exceptional points enter it.

Conclusion: Provides systematic phase-space framework for topological wave transport in continuous media beyond compact-band and idealized Hermitian settings. Establishes bulk-interface correspondence at phase-space symbol level for noncompact systems.

Abstract: Topological wave phenomena in continuous media are fundamentally challenged by unbounded spectra and the absence of a compact Brillouin zone, which obstruct conventional bulk--interface formulations. We develop a unified phase-space framework for screened magnetized plasma based on a pseudo-Hermitian formulation with a positive-definite metric, enabling a generalized Schrödinger description and a Weyl-symbol analysis of the bulk generator. We show that the bulk symbol hosts isolated band degeneracies acting as Berry--Chern monopoles, including a higher-order spin-1 degeneracy with topological charge $+2$ that generically splits into two spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Weyl points under symmetry breaking. To characterize topology in this noncompact setting, we introduce a strip-gap Chern number associated with finite real-frequency strips of the bulk spectrum, extending band Chern topology to continuum systems. This invariant governs the spectral flow of interface modes induced by spatial variations of the magnetic field and establishes a bulk--interface correspondence at the level of phase-space symbols. By solving the interface eigenvalue problem, we demonstrate that the net spectral flow across the strip gap is determined by the enclosed monopole charge. We further show that this correspondence persists under collisional damping, provided that a finite strip gap remains and no exceptional points enter it. Our results provide a systematic phase-space framework for topological wave transport in continuous media beyond compact-band and idealized Hermitian settings.

TL;DR: Quantum-chemical bonding descriptors derived from a new database of 13,000 materials improve ML model performance for predicting elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical bonding is crucial for predicting materials properties, but existing ML models rely mainly on composition/structure descriptors. There's a lack of systematically generated bonding databases for integration into ML pipelines at scale.

Method: Extended Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database to ~13,000 materials, derived new bonding descriptors, performed statistical significance tests to evaluate their impact on ML models predicting elastic/vibrational/thermodynamic properties.

Result: Incorporating quantum-chemical bonding descriptors improves predictive performance and enables identification of intuitive expressions for properties like projected force constant and lattice thermal conductivity via symbolic regression.

Conclusion: Quantum-chemical bonding descriptors provide valuable information beyond traditional composition/structure features, enhancing ML models for materials property prediction and enabling interpretable relationships through symbolic regression.

Abstract: Most machine learning models for materials science rely on descriptors based on materials compositions and structures, even though the chemical bond has been proven to be a valuable concept for predicting materials properties. Over the years, various theoretical frameworks have been developed to characterize bonding in solid-state materials. However, integrating bonding information from these frameworks into machine learning pipelines at scale has been limited by the lack of a systematically generated and validated database. Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features. Models are built to predict elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties typically associated with chemical bonding in materials. The results demonstrate that incorporating quantum-chemical bonding descriptors not only improves predictive performance but also helps identify intuitive expressions for properties such as the projected force constant and lattice thermal conductivity via symbolic regression.

TL;DR: The paper proves that critical stretch and critical energy density bond-failure criteria in peridynamics are not equivalent and produce different fracture behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously analyze and compare two common bond-failure criteria in peridynamic theory, which is fundamental for fracture modeling, to understand their differences and implications.

Method: Analytical mathematical proof and numerical simulations comparing critical stretch criterion (bonds fail at specific stretch value) and critical energy density criterion (bonds fail when energy density exceeds threshold) in bond-based peridynamic models.

Result: Mathematical proof shows the two criteria are not equivalent in general. Numerical examples demonstrate striking differences in crack dynamics including crack tip evolution, propagation, and branching patterns.

Conclusion: Critical stretch and critical energy density bond-failure criteria produce fundamentally different fracture phenomena in peridynamics, highlighting the importance of criterion selection for accurate fracture modeling.

Abstract: This paper rigorously analyzes bond failure in the peridynamic theory of solid mechanics, which is a fundamental component of fracture modeling. We compare analytically and numerically two common bond-failure criteria:~{\em critical stretch} and~{\em critical energy density}. In the former, bonds fail when they stretch to a critical value, whereas in the latter, bonds fail when the bond energy density exceeds a threshold. By focusing the analysis on bond-based models, we prove mathematically that the critical stretch criterion and the critical energy density criterion are not equivalent in general and result in different bond-breaking and fracture phenomena. Numerical examples showcase the striking differences between the effect of the two criteria on crack dynamics, including the crack tip evolution, crack propagation, and crack branching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenging problem of estimating observation parameters (response and error parameters) in inverse problems, particularly when regularization is introduced in a Bayesian framework with diffusion process priors, where posterior sampling is known to be difficult.

Method: Uses a Bayesian framework with diffusion process priors for regularization, implements an efficient MCMC algorithm for posterior sampling, and proposes a strategy for joint estimation of observation parameters and the image of interest with uncertainty quantification.

Result: The method provides an optimal estimator for both observation parameters and the image of interest, enables uncertainty quantification, and demonstrates computational efficiency and quality of estimates through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian approach with diffusion process priors and efficient MCMC sampling offers a flexible and effective solution for estimating observation parameters in inverse problems, with reliable uncertainty quantification and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This article addresses the issue of estimating observation parameters (response and error parameters) in inverse problems. The focus is on cases where regularization is introduced in a Bayesian framework and the prior is modeled by a diffusion process. In this context, the issue of posterior sampling is well known to be thorny, and a recent paper proposes a notably simple and effective solution. Consequently, it offers an remarkable additional flexibility when it comes to estimating observation parameters. The proposed strategy enables us to define an optimal estimator for both the observation parameters and the image of interest. Furthermore, the strategy provides a means of quantifying uncertainty. In addition, MCMC algorithms allow for the efficient computation of estimates and properties of posteriors, while offering some guarantees. The paper presents several numerical experiments that clearly confirm the computational efficiency and the quality of both estimates and uncertainties quantification.

*Jialun Liu,David Yang,Ian Robinson*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Fourier Vision Transformer solves strong-phase Bragg coherent diffraction imaging problems, outperforming classical methods on synthetic and experimental data with better robustness and lower reciprocal-space mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) phase retrieval becomes difficult in strong-phase regimes (beyond ±π/2) where crystal distortions exceed half a lattice spacing, causing split Bragg peaks and dense fringes that cause classical iterative solvers to stagnate or produce inconsistent solutions.

Method: Introduces an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) that directly solves block-phase, multi-domain phase retrieval from 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. The architecture couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, with shallow convolutional front and back-ends for local filtering and reconstruction.

Result: On synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise, Fourier ViT achieves lowest reciprocal-space mismatch (χ²) among compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions. On experimental La₂₋ₓCaₓMnO₄ nanocrystal data, it matches iterative benchmark χ² while improving robustness to random initializations and achieving higher success rate of low-χ² reconstructions than CNN baseline.

Conclusion: Fourier ViT provides an effective solution for strong-phase BCDI phase retrieval problems, demonstrating superior performance over classical iterative methods and neural network baselines in both synthetic and experimental scenarios, with better robustness and consistency.

Abstract: Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) phase retrieval becomes rapidly difficult in the strong-phase regime, where a crystal contains distortions beyond half a lattice spacing. An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\pm π/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions from different initialisations. Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\mathrm{Ca}_x\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($χ^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $χ^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$χ^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: WMLES study of NACA0012 airfoil flow shows conflicting grid resolution needs for laminar vs turbulent regions, requiring adaptive grids based on boundary layer thickness and disturbance injection for accurate transition prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine grid resolution requirements for wall-modeled LES to accurately predict both laminar and turbulent regions on airfoil surfaces, addressing the conflicting resolution needs between these flow regimes.

Method: Used unstructured-grid finite-volume solver with equilibrium wall function; simulated NACA0012 airfoil at 0° AoA, Re=3M; tested fully turbulent vs partially laminar scenarios; refined grids based on precursor RANS boundary layer thickness; introduced unsteady disturbances upstream of neutral point.

Result: Standard grids captured turbulent skin friction well but failed in laminar regions; refined grids improved laminar accuracy but degraded turbulent resolution; adaptive grids based on boundary layer thickness improved laminar results but delayed transition; disturbance injection enabled satisfactory transition and turbulent skin friction prediction.

Conclusion: Successful WMLES of airfoil flows with laminar-turbulent transition requires adaptive grid resolution based on local boundary layer thickness and appropriate disturbance injection to trigger natural transition processes.

Abstract: Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) is performed for flow over a wing with a focus on documenting grid resolution requirements to predict both the laminar and turbulent regions accurately. Flow over a spanwise extruded NACA0012 airfoil at 0-degree angle of attack and freestream chord-based Reynolds numbers of 3 million is simulated using an unstructured-grid finite-volume solver. An equilibrium wall function with the first off-wall grid point as the exchange location is used. Two scenarios are simulated wherein either the entire airfoil surface, or only a portion of it, is assumed turbulent based on linear stability calculations. For the latter scenario, the regular no-slip wall boundary condition is imposed in laminar regions. Using the same grid that was employed in the fully turbulent case, WMLES captured the skin friction in the turbulent region close to the RANS results. However, the skin friction is not well captured in the laminar region, due to far few grid points inside the boundary layer. When the near-wall grid was refined in the wall normal direction, the laminar region was captured accurately, but the turbulent region was not resolved well because the first off-wall point moved below the buffer-layer. To reconcile differing resolution requirements in the laminar and turbulent regions, a grid was generated based on the varying boundary layer thickness estimated from a precursor RANS simulation with a specified transition location. This grid produced improved results in the laminar region but resulted in a delayed transition location. Unsteady disturbances with the most amplified frequencies were introduced upstream of the neutral point. The transition process in the laminar region and the skin friction in the turbulent region were then captured satisfactorily.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new n-sided PL condition extending Polyak-Łojasiewicz for analyzing gradient-based algorithms in general-sum Nash equilibrium problems, with adapted GD variants for cases where standard methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient descent methods often fail to converge to Nash equilibria in general-sum games, especially with non-convex objectives. There's a need for theoretical conditions and adapted algorithms that guarantee convergence in these challenging scenarios.

Method: Introduces the n-sided PL condition extending gradient dominance and multi-convexity concepts. Analyzes first-order gradient-based algorithms (including block coordinate descent) under this condition. Proposes adapted GD variants for cases where standard methods fail to converge to NE.

Result: The n-sided PL condition enables convergence analysis of various GD algorithms for Nash equilibrium problems. The proposed adapted GD variants achieve convergence even when standard methods fail, with analyzed convergence rates. Experimental evaluation demonstrates performance.

Conclusion: The n-sided PL condition provides a useful theoretical framework for analyzing gradient-based algorithms in general-sum games. The adapted GD variants offer practical solutions for challenging Nash equilibrium problems where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium (NE) in a general-sum game, where player $i$'s objective is $f_i(x)=f_i(x_1,...,x_n)$, with $x_j\in\mathbb{R}^{d_j}$ denoting the strategy variables of player $j$. Our focus is on investigating first-order gradient-based algorithms and their variations, such as the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, for tackling this problem. We introduce a set of conditions, called the $n$-sided PL condition, which extends the well-established gradient dominance condition a.k.a Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition and the concept of multi-convexity. This condition, satisfied by various classes of non-convex functions, allows us to analyze the convergence of various gradient descent (GD) algorithms. Moreover, our study delves into scenarios where the standard gradient descent methods fail to converge to NE. In such cases, we propose adapted variants of GD that converge towards NE and analyze their convergence rates. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through several experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive non-intrusive Reduced Order Models (ROMs) that can update both latent subspaces and dynamics online, addressing limitations of static ROMs when systems leave training manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static ROMs become unreliable when systems evolve beyond their training data. The authors aim to develop adaptive ROMs that can self-correct online to maintain accuracy as dynamics change.

Method: Three adaptive formulations: 1) Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), 2) Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), and 3) Hybrid approach initializing NiTROM with OpInf updates. Includes online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget considerations.

Result: On lid-driven cavity flow with transient perturbations: Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift; Adaptive NiTROM achieves near-exact energy tracking with frequent updates but is sensitive to initialization; Hybrid approach is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, producing physically coherent fields and bounded energy.

Conclusion: ROM predictions must be cost-aware with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes. The work provides a practical template for building self-correcting, non-intrusive ROMs that remain effective as dynamics evolve beyond initial training data.

Abstract: Projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are often deployed as static surrogates, which limits their practical utility once a system leaves the training manifold. We formalize and study adaptive non-intrusive ROMs that update both the latent subspace and the reduced dynamics online. Building on ideas from static non-intrusive ROMs, specifically, Operator Inference (OpInf) and the recently-introduced Non-intrusive Trajectory-based optimization of Reduced-Order Models (NiTROM), we propose three formulations: Adaptive OpInf (sequential basis/operator refits), Adaptive NiTROM (joint Riemannian optimization of encoder/decoder and polynomial dynamics), and a hybrid that initializes NiTROM with an OpInf update. We describe the online data window, adaptation window, and computational budget, and analyze cost scaling. On a transiently perturbed lid-driven cavity flow, static Galerkin/OpInf/NiTROM drift or destabilize when forecasting beyond training. In contrast, Adaptive OpInf robustly suppresses amplitude drift with modest cost; Adaptive NiTROM is shown to attain near-exact energy tracking under frequent updates but is sensitive to its initialization and optimization depth; the hybrid is most reliable under regime changes and minimal offline data, yielding physically coherent fields and bounded energy. We argue that predictive claims for ROMs must be cost-aware and transparent, with clear separation of training/adaptation/deployment regimes and explicit reporting of online budgets and full-order model queries. This work provides a practical template for building self-correcting, non-intrusive ROMs that remain effective as the dynamics evolve well beyond the initial manifold.

*Wenqian Chen,Yucheng Fu,Michael Penwarden,Pratanu Roy,Panos Stinis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ArGEnT is a geometry-aware Transformer architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains, integrated with DeepONet to create a surrogate modeling framework that handles varying geometries without explicit geometric parametrization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning solution operators for systems with complex, varying geometries in many-query regimes (design optimization, control, inverse problems) requires surrogate models that generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations.

Method: ArGEnT (Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer) uses Transformer attention mechanisms (self-attention, cross-attention, hybrid-attention variants) to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations. It's integrated into DeepONet as the trunk network, eliminating the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as branch network input.

Result: Significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared to standard DeepONet and other geometry-aware surrogates across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and electrochemical systems. Cross-attention variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions.

Conclusion: ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities, suitable for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for systems with complex, varying geometries and parametric physical settings is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. In many-query regimes such as design optimization, control and inverse problems, surrogate modeling must generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations. In this work, we propose Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer (ArGEnT), a geometry-aware attention-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains. ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features. By integrating ArGEnT into DeepONet as the trunk network, we develop a surrogate modeling framework capable of learning operator mappings that depend on both geometric and non-geometric inputs without the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as a branch network input. Evaluation on benchmark problems spanning fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electrochemical systems, we demonstrate significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared with the standard DeepONet and other existing geometry-aware saurrogates. In particular, the cross-attention transformer variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions. By combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities, ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems.

*Oliver Gross,Florine Hartwig,Martin Rumpf,Peter Schröder*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors using sub-Riemannian geodesics to compute energy-efficient deformation gaits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive geometric model that captures overall locomotion efficiency by accounting for both environmental displacement energy and metabolic/actuator energy required for shape changes in slender locomotors like snakes and spermatozoa.

Method: Formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems solved by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Develop continuous model with consistent time and space discretization for numerical computation with three boundary condition types: fixed initial/target body, cyclic motion, or prescribed displacement/orientation.

Result: Optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms (snakes, spermatozoa) and known optimality results for low-dimensional systems like Purcell's swimmers. Model provides new insights into locomotion mechanisms of generalized Purcell's swimmers.

Conclusion: The geometric model successfully captures overall locomotion efficiency and enables computation of optimal deformation gaits that match biological observations, offering a less rigid framework than previous approaches for understanding locomotion mechanisms.

Abstract: We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

### [44] [Twisted Pollicott--Ruelle resonances and zeta function at zero on surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12166)
*Tristan Humbert,Zhongkai Tao*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: For surfaces with Anosov geodesic flow, the twisted Ruelle zeta function vanishes at s=0 with order proportional to genus for representations factoring through surface fundamental group, and equals Reidemeister-Turaev torsion otherwise, extending Fried's conjecture to generic acyclic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend Fried's conjecture about Ruelle zeta functions to a broader class of representations. Fried's conjecture relates the value of Ruelle zeta functions at zero to Reidemeister torsion for unitary acyclic representations. This work seeks to generalize this to a generic set of acyclic (not necessarily unitary) representations on surfaces with Anosov geodesic flow.

Method: The authors construct an open subset U_g of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the fundamental group of the unit tangent bundle. They compute dimensions of spaces of generalized twisted Pollicott-Ruelle resonant states at zero for any representation in U_g. This spectral analysis approach allows them to determine the vanishing order and values of the twisted Ruelle zeta function at s=0.

Result: For surfaces with Anosov geodesic flow: 1) For representations in U_g that factor through the surface fundamental group, the twisted Ruelle zeta function vanishes at s=0 to order dim(ρ)(2G-2). 2) For other representations in U_g, the zeta function doesn't vanish and ζ_{g,ρ}(0) equals the Reidemeister-Turaev torsion. The complement of U_g has complex codimension at least one, making U_g a generic set.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends Fried's conjecture to a generic set of acyclic (not necessarily unitary) representations on surfaces with Anosov geodesic flow. The results connect spectral properties (Pollicott-Ruelle resonances) with topological invariants (Reidemeister-Turaev torsion), providing a bridge between dynamical systems and topology for a broad class of representations.

Abstract: For an orientable closed surface $(Σ,g)$ of genus $G$ with Anosov geodesic flow, we show the existence of an open subset $U_g$ of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the fundamental group of its unit tangent bundle, whose complement has complex codimension at least one and such that for any $ρ\in U_g$, the twisted Ruelle zeta function $ζ_{g,ρ}(s)$ vanishes at $s=0$ to order ${\rm dim}(ρ)(2G-2)$ if $ρ$ factors through $π_1(Σ)$, and does not vanish otherwise. In the second case, we show that $ζ_{g,ρ}(0)$ is given by the Reidemeister--Turaev torsion, thus extending Fried's conjecture to a generic set of acyclic (but not necessarily unitary) representations. Our proof relies on computing the dimensions of the spaces of generalized twisted Pollicott--Ruelle resonant states at zero for any $ρ\in U_g$.

*Massimo Fornasier,Hui Huang,Jona Klemenc,Greta Malaspina*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces new CBO variants (δ-CBO, Consensus Freezing, Consensus Hopping) that address limitations of original CBO, with theoretical analysis of invariant measures and global convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address practical and theoretical limitations of the original Consensus-based optimization (CBO) method, particularly premature collapse to suboptimal states and numerical stability issues.

Method: Three new CBO variants: 1) δ-CBO with nonvanishing diffusion to prevent premature collapse, 2) Consensus Freezing scheme for numerical stability with large time steps, 3) Consensus Hopping scheme derived from time rescaling, interpretable as (1,λ)-Evolution Strategy.

Result: Characterized invariant measures for all schemes and established global convergence results with exponential convergence rates, connecting models through appropriate asymptotic limits.

Conclusion: The paper presents enhanced CBO variants with improved theoretical guarantees and practical performance, providing a more robust framework for solving high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems.

Abstract: Consensus-based optimization (CBO) is a powerful and versatile zero-order multi-particle method designed to provably solve high-dimensional global optimization problems, including those that are genuinely nonconvex or nonsmooth. The method relies on a balance between stochastic exploration and contraction toward a consensus point, which is defined via the Laplace principle as a proxy for the global minimizer.
  In this paper, we introduce new CBO variants that address practical and theoretical limitations of the original formulation of this novel optimization methodology. First, we propose a model called $δ$-CBO}, which incorporates nonvanishing diffusion to prevent premature collapse to suboptimal states. We also develop a numerically stable implementation, the Consensus Freezing scheme, that remains robust even for arbitrarily large time steps by freezing the consensus point over time intervals. We connect these models through appropriate asymptotic limits. Furthermore, we derive from the Consensus Freezing scheme by suitable time rescaling and asymptotics a further algorithm, the Consensus Hopping scheme, which can be interpreted as a form of $(1,λ)$-Evolution Strategy. For all these schemes, we characterize for the first time the invariant measures and establish global convergence results, including exponential convergence rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for real-time solutions to nonsmooth optimal control problems of linear PDEs, bridging the gap between traditional optimization algorithms and modern deep learning approaches.

Method: Unrolls inexact Uzawa method for saddle point problems, replacing classical preconditioners and PDE solvers with specifically designed learnable neural networks.

Conclusion: Provides a versatile framework for optimization-informed deep learning approaches to optimal control and PDE-constrained optimization, synergizing model-based optimization with data-driven deep learning.

Abstract: We propose an optimization-informed deep neural network approach, named iUzawa-Net, aiming for the first solver that enables real-time solutions for a class of nonsmooth optimal control problems of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The iUzawa-Net unrolls an inexact Uzawa method for saddle point problems, replacing classical preconditioners and PDE solvers with specifically designed learnable neural networks. We prove universal approximation properties and establish the asymptotic $\varepsilon$-optimality for the iUzawa-Net, and validate its promising numerical efficiency through nonsmooth elliptic and parabolic optimal control problems. Our techniques offer a versatile framework for designing and analyzing various optimization-informed deep learning approaches to optimal control and other PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed learning-to-control approach synergizes model-based optimization algorithms and data-driven deep learning techniques, inheriting the merits of both methodologies.

### [47] [Local convergence of mean-field Langevin dynamics: from gradient flows to linearly monotone games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11999)
*Guillaume Wang,Lénaïc Chizat*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Paper establishes exponential local convergence in χ²-divergence for diffusive mean-field systems under Poincaré inequality and monotonicity conditions, without requiring displacement convexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand convergence properties of diffusive mean-field systems (gradient flows, min-max dynamics, games) near equilibrium, particularly for non-gradient systems where global convergence remains open.

Method: Design a Lyapunov functional mixing χ²-divergence with weighted negative Sobolev norms, requiring two key assumptions: (1) stationary measures satisfy Poincaré inequality, (2) velocity field satisfies monotonicity condition.

Result: Establishes sharp exponential local convergence rates governed by Poincaré constant (not log-Sobolev constant) for gradient flows, and provides first local convergence results for linearly monotone multi-player games.

Conclusion: The approach yields sharp local convergence rates for both gradient and non-gradient systems, partially answering open questions about convergence in mean-field games while avoiding displacement convexity assumptions.

Abstract: We study the local convergence of diffusive mean-field systems, including Wasserstein gradient flows, min-max dynamics, and multi-species games. We establish exponential local convergence in $χ^2$-divergence with sharp rates, under two main assumptions: (i) the stationary measures satisfy a Poincaré inequality, and (ii) the velocity field satisfies a monotonicity condition, which reduces to linear convexity of the objective in the gradient flow case. We do not assume any form of displacement convexity or displacement monotonicity.
  In the gradient flow case, global exponential convergence is already known under our linear convexity assumption, with an asymptotic rate governed by the log-Sobolev constant of the stationary measure. Our contribution in this setting is to identify the sharp rate near equilibrium governed instead by the Poincaré constant. This rate coincides with the one suggested by Otto calculus (i.e. by a tight positivity estimate of the Wasserstein Hessian), and refines some results of Tamura (1984), extending them beyond quadratic objectives.
  More importantly, our proof technique extends to certain non-gradient systems, such as linearly monotone two-player and multi-player games. In this case, we obtain explicit local exponential convergence rates in $χ^2$-divergence, thereby partially answering the open question raised by the authors at COLT 2024. While that question concerns global convergence (which remains open), even local convergence results were previously unavailable.
  At the heart of our analysis is the design of a Lyapunov functional that mixes the $χ^2$-divergence with weighted negative Sobolev norms of the density relative to equilibrium.

*Jianbo Cui,Tonghe Dang,Jialin Hong,Zhengkai Wang*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: SPDEs on finite tree graphs with space-time white noise: graph structure affects strong Feller property and irreducibility. Noise-free edges have sharp upper bounds - chain graphs need noise on any single edge, star graphs allow at most one noise-free edge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how graph topology influences stochastic PDE behavior on finite tree graphs, particularly how noise distribution affects fundamental properties like strong Feller property and irreducibility.

Method: Developed a novel graph-based null decomposition approach using eigenfunctions of graph Laplacian operator. Analyzed zero entry positions in eigenfunctions to determine noise-free edge constraints. Applied dissipative condition for invariant measure analysis.

Result: Established sharp upper bound on noise-free edges for strong Feller property and irreducibility. Chain graphs require noise on any single edge; star graphs allow at most one noise-free edge. Proved existence and exponential ergodicity of unique invariant measure under dissipative condition.

Conclusion: Graph structure crucially determines noise requirements for SPDE properties on trees. Different graph topologies have distinct noise distribution constraints, with chain graphs being more robust and star graphs more sensitive to noise-free edges.

Abstract: This paper investigates how the structure of the underlying graph influences the behavior of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on finite tree graphs, where each edge is driven by space-time white noise. We first introduce a novel graph-based null decomposition approach to analyzing the strong Feller property of the Markov semigroup generated by SPDEs on tree graphs. By examining the positions of zero entries in eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian operator, we establish a sharp upper bound on the number of noise-free edges that ensures both the strong Feller property and irreducibility. Interestingly, we find that the addition of noise to any single edge is sufficient for chain graphs, whereas for star graphs, at most one edge can remain noise-free without compromising the system's properties. Furthermore, under a dissipative condition, we prove the existence and exponential ergodicity of a unique invariant measure.

TL;DR: Background rotation catalyzes chiral magnetovortical instability in chiral MHD by splitting Alfven waves into circularly polarized magneto-Coriolis waves, with one becoming unstable due to chiral vortical effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how rotation affects chiral magnetohydrodynamic instabilities and potentially enables new dynamo mechanisms in rotating chiral plasmas.

Method: Analysis of chiral magnetohydrodynamics with background rotation, studying how rotation splits linearly polarized Alfven waves into circularly polarized magneto-Coriolis waves.

Result: Rotation catalyzes chiral magnetovortical instability by creating low-frequency magneto-Coriolis waves that become unstable with even weak chiral vortical effect.

Conclusion: This instability may enable new dynamo mechanisms applicable to various rotating chiral plasmas, including astrophysical and laboratory contexts.

Abstract: We demonstrate that a background rotation significantly catalyzes the chiral magnetovortical instability in chiral magnetohydrodynamics. The rotation splits the linearly polarized Alfven wave into two circularly polarized magneto-Coriolis waves, one of which exhibits a lower frequency than the original Alfven wave. We find that this low-frequency magneto-Coriolis wave is always unstable in the presence of even a weak chiral vortical effect. This instability may enable new dynamo mechanism applicable to various rotating chiral plasmas.

*Paolo Maremonti,Filippo Palma*

Main category: math-ph

TL;DR: Existence and partial regularity of weak solutions for rigid body-fluid interaction in a body-fixed frame, with new techniques for Navier-Stokes analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the interaction between a rigid body and viscous incompressible Newtonian fluid, particularly addressing analytical challenges in the body-fixed frame where the term ω×x·∇u appears in momentum equations.

Method: Using a body-attached reference frame, developing new analytical techniques different from standard Navier-Stokes approaches to handle the rotational term, proving existence of weak solutions and providing new proof of Leray's Structure Theorem.

Result: Proved existence of weak solutions and obtained partial regularity, but only for large times (weaker than Leray's result). Provided new proof of Leray's Structure Theorem.

Conclusion: The body-fixed frame approach requires novel techniques for fluid-body interaction problems, yielding existence and partial regularity results, though with temporal limitations compared to classical Navier-Stokes theory.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and a partial regularity of a weak solution to the system governing the interaction between a rigid body and a viscous incompressible Newtonian fluid. The evolution of the system body-fluid is studied in a frame attached to the body. The choice of this special frame becomes critical from an analytical point of view due to the presence of the term $ω\times x\cdot\nabla u$ in the balance of momentum equation for the fluid. As a consequence, we are forced to look for a technique that is different from the ones usually employed both for the existence and for the partial regularity of a weak solution to the Navier-Stokes problem. Hence, we prove the existence of a weak solution in an original way and give a new proof of the celebrated Théorème de Structure due to Leray. However, the regularity obtained for our weak solution is only for large times, hence our result is weaker compared to the one obtained by Leray.
