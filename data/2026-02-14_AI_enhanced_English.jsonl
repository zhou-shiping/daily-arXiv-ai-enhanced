We do not assume any form of displacement convexity or displacement monotonicity.\n  In the gradient flow case, global exponential convergence is already known under our linear convexity assumption, with an asymptotic rate governed by the log-Sobolev constant of the stationary measure.

This rate coincides with the one suggested by Otto calculus (i.e. by a tight positivity estimate of the Wasserstein Hessian), and refines some results of Tamura (1984), extending them beyond quadratic objectives.\n  More importantly, our proof technique extends to certain non-gradient systems, such as linearly monotone two-player and multi-player games. In this case, we obtain explicit local exponential convergence rates in $\u03c7^2$-divergence, thereby partially answering the open question raised by the authors at COLT 2024. While that question concerns global convergence (which remains open), even local convergence results were previously unavailable.\n  At the heart of our analysis is the design of a Lyapunov functional that mixes the $\u03c7^2$-divergence with weighted negative Sobolev norms of the density relative to equilibrium.", "AI": {"tldr": "Paper establishes exponential local convergence in \u03c7\u00b2-divergence for diffusive mean-field systems under Poincar\u00e9 inequality and monotonicity conditions, without requiring displacement convexity.", "motivation": "To understand convergence properties of diffusive mean-field systems including Wasserstein gradient flows, min-max dynamics, and multi-species games, particularly for non-gradient systems where convergence results were previously unavailable.", "method": "Design of a Lyapunov functional mixing \u03c7\u00b2-divergence with weighted negative Sobolev norms, using Poincar\u00e9 inequality and monotonicity conditions without displacement convexity assumptions.", "result": "Established exponential local convergence with sharp rates governed by Poincar\u00e9 constant (not log-Sobolev constant), extended results to linearly monotone multi-player games, partially answering an open question from COLT 2024.", "conclusion": "The approach provides local convergence results for non-gradient systems using a novel Lyapunov functional, advancing understanding of mean-field dynamics beyond gradient flows."}}

We compare analytically and numerically two common bond-failure criteria:~{\\em critical stretch} and~{\\em critical energy density}. In the former, bonds fail when they stretch to a critical value, whereas in the latter, bonds fail when the bond energy density exceeds a threshold. By focusing the analysis on bond-based models, we prove mathematically that the critical stretch criterion and the critical energy density criterion are not equivalent in general and result in different bond-breaking and fracture phenomena.
