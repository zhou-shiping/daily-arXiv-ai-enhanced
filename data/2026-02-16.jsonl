The proposed scheme is unconditionally stable in the diffusive regime while preserving the correct asymptotic behavior, and can achieve significant reductions in computational cost through a low-rank representation and large time step stability. A low-rank formulation consistent with the discrete energy is introduced under the discrete ordinates discretization, and energy stability of the resulting scheme is established. Numerical experiments confirm the energy stability and demonstrate that the method is efficient while maintaining accuracy across different regimes and capturing the correct asymptotic limits."}

In these energy-based methods, the governing equations can be obtained directly by considering the derivatives of a single global energy functional. While Automatic Differentiation (AD) can be used to automate the generation of these derivatives, current frameworks face a clear trade-off based primarily on the scale upon which the AD method is applied. Globally applied AD offers high expressivity but cannot currently be scaled to large problems. Locally applied AD scales well through traditional assembly methods, but the variety of physics and couplings that the framework can easily represent is more limited than the global approach. Here, we introduce an energy-centric framework tatva (https://github.com/smec-ethz/tatva) that defines the physics of a problem as a single global functional and applies AD globally to generate residual and tangent operators. By leveraging Jacobian-vector products for matrix-free solvers and coloring-based sparse differentiation for materializing sparse tangent stiffness matrices when needed, our flexible design scales linearly with the problem size on GPUs. We demonstrate that our framework can handle large problems (with millions of degrees of freedom) without memory exhaustion. Additionally, it offers a unified, fully differentiable methodology that can address a wide range of problems, including multi-point constraints, mixed-dimensional coupling, and the incorporation of neural networks, while maintaining high performance and scalability on modern GPU architectures."}

Linear dispersion analysis yields a modified DA phase speed. Nonlinear solitary structures are investigated using the Sagdeev pseudopotential method. The system is found to support only negative potential (rarefactive) DA solitary waves within a bounded subsonic Mach number interval. The critical Mach number, consequently, the corresponding linear DA speed show an explicit dependence on the degeneracy parameters and the ion spectral index. The amplitude and width of the solitary structures are shown to be highly sensitive to the electron (positron) degeneracy strength, the ion positron concentration ratios, the ion temperature ratio, and the superthermality of the ions.

This demands lasers with high power and intensity, posing engineering challenges that have called into question the fundamental practicality of fast ignition. Magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF) circumvents these problems through its large-aspect-ratio cylindrical geometry and strong axial magnetic fields that allow for ignition at lower areal densities. Furthermore, MagLIF's large aspect ratio and higher yields relax other constraints on energy deposition and repetition rate while its axial magnetic fields can be used to collimate ignitor electrons and thereby increase allowed standoff distance and save on ignitor energy. This tremendous overall relaxation of the engineering constraints that have historically limited the practicality of fast ignition suggests that the paradigm may be considerably more viable in a MagLIF context."}

We present an importance sampling method designed to accelerate the time scale of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. By employing a bias potential, our approach enhances the sampling of rare transition events while preserving the relative probabilities of distinct transition pathways. The bias potential is represented by a neural network which enables the flexibility needed for high-dimensional systems.

The calculated mass densities and kinematic viscosities of nanomelts for metal nanotips are found to be drastically different to those of bulk liquid metals at the melting point.

The experimental validation of this optimization is difficult since, with the available power, achieving high $β$ under appropriate conditions for the validation is challenging and the effect of the radial electric field is inevitable. In this work, the confinement of fast ions in W7-X has been studied numerically for a variety of scenarios via the ASCOT5 code.

This document is the Accepted Manuscript of a published article in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, copyright \\c{opyright} American Chemical Society", "summary": "Assessing the time scale of biological processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with sufficient statistical accuracy is a challenging task, as processes are often rare and/or slow events, which may extend largely beyond the time scale of what is accessible with modern day high performance computational infrastructure. Recently, the replica exchange partial path transition interface sampling (REPPTIS) algorithm was developed to study rare and slow events involving metastable states along their reactive pathways. REPPTIS is a path sampling method where paths are cut short to reduce the computational cost, while combining this with the efficiency offered by replica exchange between the partial path ensembles. However, REPPTIS still lacks a formalism to extract time-dependent properties, such as mean first passage times, fluxes, and rates, from the short partial paths. In this work, we introduce a Markov state model (MSM) framework to estimate full path lengths and kinetic properties from the overlapping partial paths generated by REPPTIS. The framework results in newly derived closed formulas for the REPPTIS crossing probability, mean first passage times (MFPTs), flux, and rate constant. Our approach is then validated using simulations of Brownian and Langevin particles on a series of one-dimensional potential energy profiles as well as the dissociation of KCl in solution, demonstrating that REPPTIS accurately reproduces the exact kinetics benchmark. The MSM framework is further applied to the trypsin-benzamidine complex to compute the dissociation rate as a test case of a biological system, albeit the computed rate underestimates the experimental value. In conclusion, our MSM framework equips REPPTIS simulations with a robust theoretical and practical foundation for extracting kinetic information from computationally efficient partial paths."}

We first present the underlying mathematical model, which is based on a recently derived formulation involving, in particular, only first order in time derivatives. We then propose a spacetime discontinuous Galerkin discretization of this model, combining a symmetric Friedrichs systems discretization for symmetric hyperbolic systems with an interior penalty discretization for damping terms. The resulting nonlinear system is solved using Newton's method. Next, we present a well-posedness analysis of the discrete problem. The analysis begins with a linearized system, for which stability is shown. Using a fixed point argument, these results are extended to the fully discrete nonlinear system, yielding a priori error estimates in a natural discontinuous Galerkin norm. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating the parallel solvability of the spacetime formulation and the effectiveness of p-adaptivity. The results confirm the theoretical convergence rates and show that adaptive refinement can reduce the number of degrees of freedom required to accurately approximate selected goal functionals. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate that the model reproduces characteristic phenomena of nonlinear acoustics, such as harmonic generation, thereby validating the proposed model."}

However, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is expected to be reduced in the low-Mach-number, weakly turbulent environments characteristic of cluster merger shocks, and recent results suggest that DSA itself may not constitute a viable physical mechanism. In this work, we investigate ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) as an electrodynamically grounded mechanism for electron energization that does not rely on prescribed diffusion coefficients. We formulate BSA under typical cluster shock conditions and derive the balance between coherent acceleration by the shock convection electric field and radiative losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling. This balance determines both the maximum electron energy and the resulting steady-state spectrum. By forward-modeling the associated synchrotron emission and comparing it with integrated radio observations of the Sausage and Toothbrush relics, we find that the observed spectral curvature and high-frequency steepening can be reproduced when only a very small fraction ($\\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$) of the available BSA acceleration capacity contributes to systematic electron energization. Despite this extremely small efficiency, it is sufficient to accelerate electrons to Lorentz factors $γ\\sim 10^4 - 10^5$ under cluster conditions. These results suggest that radio relics provide a promising astrophysical laboratory for probing coherent acceleration, and that the BSA framework may account for the production of relativistic electrons in cluster shocks."}

We investigate a model whereby ORCs are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe in the intergalactic medium using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These rings initially exhibit oscillatory behavior that damps over time. We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic."}

Each method requires merely minor modifications to commonly-used existing methods, i.e., the sine spectral/Fourier quadrature method, and achieves a much better convergence rate. The key lies in the introduction of a smooth auxiliary function $ρ_1$ whose moments match those of the density up to an integer order $m$. Specifically, $ρ_1$ is constructed using Gaussian function in an explicit way and the associated potential can be calculated analytically. The moments of residual density vanish up to order $m$, and the corresponding residual potential $U \\ast (ρ-ρ_1)$ decays much faster than the original potential $\\varphi$ at the far field. As for the residual potential evaluation, for classical kernels (e.g., the Coulomb kernel), we solve a differential/pseudo-differential equation on a rectangular domain with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions via sine pseudospectral method, and achieve an arbitrary high convergence rate. While, for general kernels, the regularity of Fourier integrand increase by $m$ thanks to the moments-vanishing property, therefore, the standard trapezoidal rule/midpoint quadrature also converges much faster. To gain a better numerical performance, we utilize the domain expansion technique to obtain better accuracy, and improve the efficiency by simplifying the quadrature into one discrete convolution and applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to a double-sized vector.

In this letter, we assess the capability of NQS-VMC to efficiently capture correlation in electronic ground states by comparing it to a recently developed NQS-based selected configuration (NQS-SC) approach. We set up a systematic comparison of the ground-state optimizations obtained with NQS-VMC and NQS-SC for molecular systems dominated by either static or dynamical correlation. The comparison demonstrates a clear advantage of NQS-SC over NQS-VMC in both energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients, particularly for statically correlated molecules. Moreover, NQS-SC exhibits robust systematic improvability, whereas NQS-VMC does not. These findings position NQS-SC as the new default approach over NQS-VMC for electronic structure calculations. We further observe that neither NQS-SC nor NQS-VMC can efficiently capture dynamical correlation, highlighting the need for future hybrid methods, such as multiconfigurational perturbation theories built on top of NQS solutions."}

These are usually very inefficient, since small step sizes increase computational cost, while larger steps could jeopardize the method convergence jumping to a different solution branch or missing the bifurcation point. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines: (i) arclength continuation, adaptively selecting new parameter values in higher dimension, and (ii) the deflation technique, discovering multiple branches to construct complete bifurcation diagrams. In particular, the arclength continuation method is designed to handle multiparametric scenarios, where the parameter vector $λ\\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ traces a curve $g(λ)$ within a $p$-dimensional parameter space.

The simulation of these batteries relies on multiphysics modeling to evaluate performance and behavior under various conditions. This paper presents advancements in scalable preconditioning strategies for the Thermally Activated Battery Simulator (TABS) tool, enabling efficient solutions to the coupled electrochemical systems that dominate computational costs in thermal battery simulations. We propose a hierarchical block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner implemented through the Teko package in Trilinos, which effectively addresses the challenges posed by tightly coupled physics, including charge transport, porous flow, and species diffusion. The preconditioner leverages scalable subblock solvers, including smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid (SA-AMG) methods and domain-decomposition techniques, to achieve robust convergence and parallel scalability. Strong and weak scaling studies demonstrate the solver's ability to handle problem sizes up to 51.3 million degrees of freedom on 2048 processors, achieving near sub-second setup and solve times for the end-to-end electrochemical solve. These advancements significantly improve the computational efficiency and turnaround time of thermal battery simulations, paving the way for higher-resolution models and enabling the transition from 2D axisymmetric to full 3D simulations."}

Since the operator associated with the linearized system is neither self-adjoint nor skew-adjoint, its (known) spectral properties are not directly amenable to the moment method, leaving optimal cost bounds an open problem. We address this difficulty by shifting attention to a related KdV system and deriving the optimal bounds from the new one."}

The bottom layer is occupied by an incompressible fluid in liquid phase with hydrodynamics based on a hydrostatic pressure, following a shallow water approximation. The top layer is occupied by a compressible gas, following an ideal gas law leading to conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The two subsystems are linked through non-conservative products, representing momentum and energy exchanges between layers. The hyperbolic properties of the resulting model are analyzed, including the derivation of entropy inequalities, and the approximations of eigenvalues of the corresponding coefficient matrix. Numerical tests are included to demonstrate the merits of the model and the numerical approximations, including well-balancedness, Riemann problems, and perturbations and convergence toward steady states at rest. Besides simulations of water and air where the density difference between layers is significant, a case where such difference is not so pronounced (like gas and liquid hydrogen) is also shown."}

Workflows for recovering scalar PDE parameters from data are well studied: here we show how similar workflows can be used to recover functions from data. Specifically, we embed neural networks into the PDE and show how, as they are trained on data, they can approximate unknown functions with arbitrary accuracy. Using nonlocal aggregation-diffusion equations as a case study, we recover interaction kernels and external potentials from steady state data. Specifically, we investigate how a wide range of factors, such as the number of available solutions, their properties, sampling density, and measurement noise, affect our ability to successfully recover functions. Our approach is advantageous because it can utilise standard parameter-fitting workflows, and in that the trained PDE can be treated as a normal PDE for purposes such as generating system predictions."}

For an error target of $\\varepsilon>0$, we establish approximation-theoretic separations: Any network built from standard fixed activations can be uniformly approximated on compact domains by a rational-activation network with only $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$ overhead in size, while the converse provably requires $Ω(\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$ parameters in the worst case. This exponential gap persists at the level of full networks and extends to gated activations and transformer-style nonlinearities. In practice, rational activations integrate seamlessly into standard architectures and training pipelines, allowing rationals to match or outperform fixed activations under identical architectures and optimizers."}

A natural question is whether this favorable behavior persists for random matrices whose entries obey additional structure, i.e., their position inside of the matrix. A prominent class of structured matrices is given by {\\it Toeplitz matrices}, characterized by constant diagonals. A particular tractable subclass is that of circulant matrices, whose additional characteristic (its entries {\\it circulate} row by row) allows one to express their conditioning in terms of the localization of the zeros of a associated polynomial. When the entries of a circulant matrix are iid, the matrix is well conditioned precisely when the corresponding random polynomial has no zeros on the unit circle. This connection is especially relevant because, as the degree of a random polynomial increases, its zeros tend to concentrate near the unit circle, making it a delicate problem to quantify how close the closest zeros lie to the unit circle. Another notable family within the Toeplitz class is that of {\\it banded Toeplitz matrices}, namely matrices for which only finitely many diagonals around the main diagonal may be nonzero. These matrices have been extensively studied in Operator Theory, nevertheless, despite their apparent simplicity, they raise subtle questions regarding the behavior of their condition numbers. In present work we show that the bandwidth asymmetry plays a decisive role: if the band contains $r$ diagonals below and $s$ diagonal above the main diagonal, then if $r=s$ the banded Toeplitz matriz is well conditioned with high probability, whereas if $r\\neq s$ it is typically ill conditioned. This highlights that structural constraints can have a impact on the numerical behavior of random matrices."}

Missing entries can degrade inferred topology and branch lengths, and generic matrix-completion methods may disrupt tree-like (ultrametric) structure.\n  Results: We propose Hyb-Adam-UM, which starts from an alignment-limited Needleman-Wunsch distance backbone and completes the matrix by minimizing a robust triplet ultrametric-violation functional. An Adam-style finite-difference optimizer updates only missing entries while enforcing symmetry, non-negativity, and a zero diagonal. From one complete reference matrix, we generate 20 masked instances at 30%, 50%, 65%, and 85% missingness. Hyb-Adam-UM consistently reduces ultrametric violations and achieves competitive reconstruction error, with improved topological accuracy and branch-length agreement relative to MW*/NJ* projection baselines (which exactly preserve observed distances) and Soft-Impute; gains are most pronounced at 85% missingness.\n  Availability and implementation: https://github.com/mitichya/hyb-adam-um/; Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18609748\n  Supplementary information: Supplementary data available online."}
