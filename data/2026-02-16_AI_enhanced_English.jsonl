Recently, the replica exchange partial path transition interface sampling (REPPTIS) algorithm was developed to study rare and slow events involving metastable states along their reactive pathways. REPPTIS is a path sampling method where paths are cut short to reduce the computational cost, while combining this with the efficiency offered by replica exchange between the partial path ensembles. However, REPPTIS still lacks a formalism to extract time-dependent properties, such as mean first passage times, fluxes, and rates, from the short partial paths. In this work, we introduce a Markov state model (MSM) framework to estimate full path lengths and kinetic properties from the overlapping partial paths generated by REPPTIS. The framework results in newly derived closed formulas for the REPPTIS crossing probability, mean first passage times (MFPTs), flux, and rate constant. Our approach is then validated using simulations of Brownian and Langevin particles on a series of one-dimensional potential energy profiles as well as the dissociation of KCl in solution, demonstrating that REPPTIS accurately reproduces the exact kinetics benchmark. The MSM framework is further applied to the trypsin-benzamidine complex to compute the dissociation rate as a test case of a biological system, albeit the computed rate underestimates the experimental value.

We propose a data-driven approach for learning FBP filters and projection weights directly from training data, with the goal of improving robustness without sacrificing computational efficiency. The resulting reconstructions adapt naturally to the noise level and acquisition geometry, while retaining the speed and simplicity of classical back-projection. The proposed method can be formulated as a regularized optimization problem for a linear inverse operator, which allows us to establish existence, uniqueness, and stability of the learned solution. From a spectral viewpoint, the learned filters act as data-adaptive gain functions that explicitly balance noise amplification and bias, in close analogy to a regularized pseudo-inverse. Experiments in both 2D and 3D show consistent improvements over conventional FBP and FDK in different case studies. Finally, we show that filters trained on synthetic laminography data generalize well to real-world measurements, delivering image quality comparable to advanced iterative methods without the high computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "A data-driven approach learns FBP filters and projection weights from training data to improve robustness of tomographic reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency of classical back-projection.", "motivation": "Filtered back projection (FBP) degrades with noise, incomplete sampling, or non-standard geometries.

A natural question is whether this favorable behavior persists for random matrices whose entries obey additional structure, i.e., their position inside of the matrix. A prominent class of structured matrices is given by {\\it Toeplitz matrices}, characterized by constant diagonals. A particular tractable subclass is that of circulant matrices, whose additional characteristic (its entries {\\it circulate} row by row) allows one to express their conditioning in terms of the localization of the zeros of a associated polynomial. When the entries of a circulant matrix are iid, the matrix is well conditioned precisely when the corresponding random polynomial has no zeros on the unit circle. This connection is especially relevant because, as the degree of a random polynomial increases, its zeros tend to concentrate near the unit circle, making it a delicate problem to quantify how close the closest zeros lie to the unit circle. Another notable family within the Toeplitz class is that of {\\it banded Toeplitz matrices}, namely matrices for which only finitely many diagonals around the main diagonal may be nonzero. These matrices have been extensively studied in Operator Theory, nevertheless, despite their apparent simplicity, they raise subtle questions regarding the behavior of their condition numbers. In present work we show that the bandwidth asymmetry plays a decisive role: if the band contains $r$ diagonals below and $s$ diagonal above the main diagonal, then if $r=s$ the banded Toeplitz matriz is well conditioned with high probability, whereas if $r\\neq s$ it is typically ill conditioned. This highlights that structural constraints can have a impact on the numerical behavior of random matrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Banded Toeplitz matrices with symmetric bandwidth (r=s) are well-conditioned with high probability, while asymmetric bandwidth (r\u2260s) leads to ill-conditioning.", "motivation": "To understand how structural constraints in random matrices (beyond iid entries) affect conditioning, specifically examining Toeplitz matrices with banded structure.", "method": "Analyzing banded Toeplitz matrices with r diagonals below and s diagonals above the main diagonal, studying the impact of bandwidth symmetry/asymmetry on condition numbers.", "result": "Bandwidth symmetry is crucial: when r=s, banded Toeplitz matrices are well-conditioned with high probability; when r\u2260s, they are typically ill-conditioned.", "conclusion": "Structural constraints significantly impact numerical behavior of random matrices, with bandwidth asymmetry playing a decisive role in conditioning of banded Toeplitz matrices."}}
