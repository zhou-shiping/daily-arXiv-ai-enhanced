This blurs operator structure, thereby confounding solution approximation error with governing-equation enforcement error and making the solving and learning progress hard to interpret and control. Here we introduce the Neural Basis Method, a projection-based formulation that couples a predefined, physics-conforming neural basis space with an operator-induced residual metric to obtain a well-conditioned deterministic minimization. Stability and reliability then hinge on this metric: the residual is not merely an optimization objective but a computable certificate tied to approximation and enforcement, remaining stable under basis enrichment and yielding reduced coordinates that are learnable across parametric instances. We use advective multiscale Darcian dynamics as a concrete demonstration of this broader point. Our method produce accurate and robust solutions in single solves and enable fast and effective parametric inference with operator learning."}

We employ high-order summation-by-parts finite-difference operators in conjunction with simultaneous-approximation-terms (SATs) in curvilinear coordinates for spatial derivatives, combined with first- and second-order time discretizations and temporal extrapolation at the interface. Energy stability is maintained by carefully selecting SAT parameters at the interface. A range of coupling parameters are explored to identify those that yield a stable scheme, and a stepwise approach for choosing SAT parameters that ensure stability is given. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical experiments in a two-dimensional model problem on a rectangular domain with curvilinear grids. The proposed approach enables the development of high-order, conditionally stable partitioned solvers suitable for general geometries."}

In practice, forward projectors and backprojectors are often implemented with different discretizations or accelerations, leading to unmatched projector pairs. This mismatch violates the adjointness assumptions underlying classical least-squares solvers, so the resulting iterations no longer correspond to a true least-squares problem and can exhibit non-symmetric or inconsistent behavior. Prior work has explored Krylov subspace solvers such as AB-GMRES and BA-GMRES to handle unmatched projector pairs, where these methods exhibit semi-convergent regularizing behavior. Under matched conditions, AB-GMRES and BA-GMRES reduce to LSQR and LSMR, respectively. However, in the presence of unmatched projectors, AB- and BA-GMRES have been observed to yield improved reconstruction quality compared to classical least-squares solvers. In this paper, we develop hybrid AB- and BA-GMRES methods that incorporate Tikhonov regularization directly into the Krylov subspace iterations. We also examine the relationship between the proposed methods and hybrid variants of LSQR and LSMR, considering both matched and unmatched backprojectors. We propose automatic strategies for selecting regularization parameters, including approaches based on the L-curve and generalized cross validation (GCV), and analyze their effect on convergence behavior and image quality. Numerical experiments on two-dimensional CT problems using GPU-accelerated projectors demonstrate that the proposed hybrid AB- and BA-GMRES methods mitigate semi-convergence, produce higher-quality reconstructions, and exhibit more stable stopping behavior than their non-hybrid counterparts."}

A variational approach for calculating flux tube energy is developed to overcome this force error problem in stellarator numerical equilibria. Saturated (equilibrium) flux tube states that cross 10-20% of the plasma minor radius are shown to exist for linearly ballooning unstable profiles. It is shown that several features of the displaced flux tube structure in a full nonlinear MHD simulation of Wendelstein 7X are reproduced by our model. Saturated states are found in a compact stellarator equilibrium close but below the marginal ballooning linear instability, i.e. the unperturbed equilibrium is metastable.

We demonstrate the advantages of iCKANs using both synthetic data and experimental data of the viscoelastic polymer materials VHB 4910 and VHB 4905. The results demonstrate that iCKANs accurately capture complex viscoelastic behavior while preserving physical interpretability. It is a particular strength of iCKANs that they can process not only mechanical data but also arbitrary additional information available about a material (e.g., about temperature-dependent behavior).

Advances in additive manufacturing have enabled nature-inspired geometries, such as lattice and triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures, which enhance heat transfer through complex first-order surfaces but frequently cause excessive pressure drops. This study proposes an optimized higher-order harmonic heat-transfer surface tessellation developed through an optimization framework integrating analytical and numerical methods. The goal is to improve the overall thermal-hydraulic performance of the heat exchanger over a range of operating conditions. Results of sensitivity analysis show that secondary surface modification of this type can yield significant increase in the effectiveness reaching up to 70% although with associated increase in the pressure drop. The secondary surface wave frequency was found to be a more important control parameter than the amplitude in achieving high thermal-hydraulic performance. Additionally, we show that the optimized second order harmonic-type structure achieved relatively higher effectiveness and lower pressure-drop than the gyroid structure in the turbulent flow regime for Re>=7000. Although the gyroid TPMS structure had relatively higher effectiveness in the laminar and weakly turbulent flow regime, the associated pressure drop was found to be significantly higher than that of the harmonic-type structure."}

Recent experimental realization of metallenes in the Ångström limit has further intensified interest in this class of 2D materials. However, achieving sub-atomic insight into them demands the most detailed and systematic characterization of their electronic structure. Such understanding is essential for the rational design and exploitation of their properties in plasmonics, catalysis, and quantum optics. Existing electronic-structure studies are either scattered or focus on a few selected systems, and a comprehensive view of their band structures and Fermi surfaces remains missing. Here, we address this gap by studying 45 elemental metallenes in six monolayer lattices (honeycomb, square, hexagonal, and their buckled forms) using density-functional theory. We found that lattice type primarily fixes the shape and radial placement of the Fermi-lines, while out-of-plane buckling introduces controlled modifications: it shortens long straight Fermi-line segments, and occasionally creates, removes, or merges small Fermi-line pockets. The electronic configuration determines which orbital type dominates the Fermi level. We summarized Fermiology using a single score for each element, termed pocketness, derived from four descriptors that combine element properties (symmetry, coordination) with electronic characteristics (dispersion, Fermi-surface topology). This score enables targeted angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) tests, controlled Lifshitz transitions, and provides a predictive basis for transport and device applications."}

Although linear momentum transfer from swift electrons to nanoparticles has been investigated theoretically and experimentally, subsequent analyzes revealed that several earlier predictions relied on non-causal dielectric functions or insufficient numerical convergence, leading to spurious sign reversals in the transferred momentum. Here, we derive analytical expressions and develop a numerically efficient electrodynamic framework to compute the linear momentum transferred from a swift electron to an isolated spherical nanoparticle described by a fully causal, local dielectric response. We apply our framework to large nanoparticles with 50 nm radius and explicitly resolve the spectral density of linear momentum transfer across the full frequency domain. Using causal dielectric functions for aluminum and bismuth, we analyze the role of electron velocity, impact parameter, and material-specific resonances. We find that, when causality and full multipolar convergence are enforced, the net transverse linear momentum transferred to spherical nanoparticles remains attractive toward the electron trajectory for all nanoparticles considered, despite the presence of material-dependent sign changes in individual electric and magnetic contributions. These results contrast with earlier theoretical predictions of net repulsive behavior and indicate that additional physical mechanisms beyond the present isolated, local description are required to account for experimentally observed repulsion. Our work establishes a robust reference framework for momentum transfer calculations and provides quantitative benchmarks relevant for electron-beam-based nanoscale manipulation."}

Given data on model observables, the estimation of parameterized model-error representations, along with other model parameters, would be ideally done while separating the contributions of each of the two sets of parameters, in order to ensure meaningful stand-alone model predictions. This work builds an embedded model error framework using a weight-space representation of Gaussian processes (GPs) to flexibly capture model-error spatiotemporal correlations and enable inference with GP-embedding in non-linear models. To disambiguate model and model-error/bias parameters, we extend an existing orthogonal GP method to the embedded model-error setting and derive appropriate orthogonality constraints. To address the increased dimensionality introduced by the GP representation, we employ the likelihood-informed subspace method. The construction is demonstrated on linear and non-linear examples, where it effectively corrects model predictions to match data trends. Extrapolation beyond the training data recovers the prior predictive distribution, and the orthogonality constraints lead to meaningful stand-alone model predictions and nearly uncorrelated posteriors between model and model-error parameters."}

As such, it has found wide adoption for the theoretical and computational description of multiple-scattering phenomena. In its original form, the T-matrix describes the interaction of a scatterer with a monochromatic source. In practice, however, information about the T-matrix is usually needed in an extended spectral domain. To access the frequency-dispersion, one might naively sample T-matrices over a finely resolved set of discrete frequencies and store one T-matrix per frequency. This approach has multiple drawbacks: it is computationally expensive, requires excessive memory, and it disregards the physical origin of the spectral features, weakening physical interpretability. To overcome these major limitations, we leverage a pole-expansion technique to represent the T-matrix with arbitrary frequency resolution within a selected frequency domain via a set of resonant contributions. A matrix-valued variant of the recently established adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational approximation enables us to compute the pole-expansion at minimal computational cost using only a small number of direct evaluations. We demonstrate the benefits of such a representation with examples ranging from semi-analytically accessible scatterers to quasi-dual bound states in the continuum. To allow the wider community to capitalize on these findings, we provide open-source tools to perform the presented pole-expansion of the T-matrix."}

A central contribution is the explicit computation of the outgoing free space Greens function for the operator $(-Δ)^s-k^{2s}$, for all $0<s<1$, any dimension and $k>0$, obtained via contour integration and a limiting absorption principle. We show that its asymptotic behavior at infinity coincides with a rescaled version of the classical Helmholtz fundamental solution, thereby justifying the standard Sommerfeld radiation condition for compactly supported sources. In addition, using resolvent estimates and a limiting absorption framework, we establish existence and uniqueness of outgoing solutions for compactly supported data, and for weighted sources. We further derive a convolution representation of the solution in terms of the outgoing fundamental solution. For inhomogeneous media with compactly supported perturbations, we reformulate the problem as a Lippmann Schwinger integral equation of Fredholm type and prove unique solvability away from a discrete set of frequencies.

To tackle these problems, we introduce new analytical tools such as a generalized weak Kelvin transform and a fractional Robin-to-Robin map. Finally, we provide numerical simulations for one of the reconstruction methods, illustrating the stability issues and the severe ill-posedness inherent to such inverse problems."}

In this paper, assuming adequate regularity of the initial data, we establish strong convergence in $L^2(Ω)$ of several semi-implicit and implicit fully discrete finite element schemes for the sLLB equation, together with explicit convergence rates. The analysis relies on localised error estimates and new exponential moment bounds for the exact solution. As a by-product, these moment bounds yield mean-square exponential stability of solutions and uniqueness of the invariant measure in one spatial dimension under a small noise assumption. We also sharpen existing convergence-in-probability results for the numerical schemes. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate and support the theoretical findings."}
