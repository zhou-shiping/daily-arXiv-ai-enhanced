In this work, we analyze the recently proposed hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model, which describes fluid flows in coupled free-flow and porous-medium systems with arbitrary flow directions at the fluid--porous interface. The model results from vertical averaging and contains several unknown parameters. We perform surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices to investigate the sensitivity of the model to variations of physical parameters for two test cases: filtration and splitting flows. However, constructing surrogates for higher-dimensional random fields requires either many training runs or sophisticated sampling strategies. To address this, we compare polynomial chaos surrogates, including sparse and multi-resolution representations, for their efficiency in global sensitivity analysis, using a predefined Sobol' sequence of training samples.

In the case of plates, transverse shear locking is most prominent, for shells several other types of locking exist. A common cure are mixed methods that introduce additional fields of unknowns into the variational formulation. These fields reduce constraints and thus alleviate locking significantly. As a drawback, the discretized additional fields increase computational costs significantly. These fields are often eliminated by static condensation, which requires the inverse of a part of the stiffness matrix. In Lagrange-based finite elements, this inverse is computed on element level, due to a discontinuous interpolation of additional fields. Since isogeometric analysis features higher continuity, static condensation must be performed on patch level, which requires a costly matrix inversion on that level. In this contribution, the virtual shear parameters of a mixed isogeometric plate formulation are interpolated by enhanced approximate dual basis functions. This allows to conduct row-sum lumping of the relevant matrix part at a minimal loss of accuracy, since this part becomes diagonal dominant. For a properly chosen integration space, this lumped matrix becomes the identity matrix. Thus, the proposed condensation procedure does not require an inversion anymore. The crucial and novel point is the proposed treatment of knot vectors with limited internal continuity. With the help of several single- and multi-patch examples, both with full and with limited internal continuity, we show that the proposed procedure obtains optimal error convergence rates in all cases, while without these alterations, convergence rates are significantly deteriorated.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes enhanced dual basis functions for mixed isogeometric plate analysis to enable row-sum lumping, eliminating costly matrix inversion in static condensation while maintaining optimal convergence rates.", "motivation": "Mixed methods in isogeometric analysis require static condensation that involves costly matrix inversion on patch level due to higher continuity, unlike Lagrange elements where it's done on element level.", "method": "Interpolate virtual shear parameters using enhanced approximate dual basis functions, enabling row-sum lumping of relevant matrix part which becomes diagonal dominant.
